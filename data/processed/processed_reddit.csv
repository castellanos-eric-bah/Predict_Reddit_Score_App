Cheers to my fellow mediocre data scientists who don't work at FAANG companies, aren't pursing a PhD, don't publish papers, haven't won Kaggle competitions, and don't spend every waking hour improving their portfolio.  Even though we're nothing special, we still deserve some appreciation every once in a while.

Hi,

My girlfriend is a 22 year old university student passionate about data science, and she just posted my first article on Medium using Machine-Learning (that took her months of research and coding to put together). Her post only has about 500 views, but to her surprise today a reddit user called [**Dean-Hoffman**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Dean-Hoffman/) **posted a link to his own data science company where he copy-pasted her article.** He didn't contact her about reposting it, didn't give her proper credit and **ridiculously added a ""Contact Data Scientist"" at the end with his name on it**. On the article, he clearly stated he is the author in multiple locations. This is the ""Data Science"" company that links from the article on his website: [https://www.actionablelabs.com/](https://www.actionablelabs.com/)

Apparently the guy Dean Hoffman is the ""founder"" of the company and refers to himself on the About Us as **""offering the highest commitment to excellence, personal integrity, and business ethics.""**

Update: Hey, this is the girlfriend that wrote the article. First of all, thank you all that made the time to reply, research and help me find answers. It's really appreciated.  So far, this is what we know about this person (or people):

\- This website has been stealing hundreds, if not thousands, of data science projects and articles from legitimate data scientists and writers.

\- The stolen content website in definitely bot-operated as the owner posts dozens of articles a day, completely copy+paste, mainly from Medium, TechCrunch and Towards Data Science.

\- It's confirmed that Dean-Hoffman from the Linkedin that links from his company (Actionable Labs) is a real person and the same Dean-Hoffman that is stealing content and running a data company.

\- If you go on his linkedin, under ""Data Scientist - Pennsylvania Department of General Services"" you will find that he mentions ""Actionable Insights"" (the stolen content website) in one of his experiences. Completely absurd.

UPDATE 2: Medium and TDS unfortunately can't do much for me individually as the authors are the ones who own the rights to the articles. TDS will try to reach out to the owner and ask them to take the posts down. I hope they see that their whole website is being copied, which would most likely infringe their TOS.

Please don't comment anything that contains the words ""copyright"", ""infringement"" or related words on her article as it may trigger keyword algorithms that delete copyrighted articles posted to Medium (and thus could have her article deleted). Thank you!

I ask of you, please take into consideration data science is only useful for exploratory analysis at this point. Please take into account that current common tools in ""data science"" are ""bias reinforcers"", not great to predict on fat and long tailed distributions. The algorithms are not objective and there's epidemiologists, virologists (read data scientists) who can do a better job at this than you. Statistical analysis will eat machine learning in this task. Don't pretend to use AI, it won't work.

Don't pretend to crowd source over kaggle, your data is old and stale the moment it comes out unless the outbreak has fully ended for a month in your data. If you have a skill you also need the expertise of people IN THE FIELD OF HEALTHCARE. If your best work is overfitting some algorithm to be a kaggle ""grand master"" then please seriously consider studying decision making under risk and uncertainty and refrain from giving advice.

Machine learning is label (or bias) based, take into account that the labels could be wrong that the cleaning operations are wrong. If you really want to help, look to see if there's teams of doctors or healthcare professionals who need help. Don't create a team of non-subject-matter-expert ""data scientists"". Have people who understand biology.

I know people see this as an opportunity to become famous and build a portfolio and some others see it as an opportunity to help. If you're the type that wants to be famous, trust me you won't. You can't bring a knife (logistic regression) to a tank fight.",1

47,Career tips from an old timer,875,howrzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/howrzj/career_tips_from_an_old_timer/,128,"I have slightly over 12 years of experience, pretty much all of it in the tech industry. I started as a Business Analyst 12+ years ago in a startup based out of the midwestern USA right after undergrad degree in Engineering. Data Scientist as a title didn't exist back then, but I still did a bunch of statistical modeling in SAS. 

Later, moved to the tech division of a Fortune 50 company in the Bay Area, again as a BA. Then moved to a FAANG company as a DS, which opened the door for other FAANGs, so I spent time in two more FAANGs in various roles before moving to a bay area unicorn. In this time I also finished a masters in my employer's dime.

Had promotions in every company I worked in, except for one in the middle because of my tenure being too short. Here are some tips to aspiring and current data scientists.

1. **Getting hired:** I'll admit, I got ridiculously lucky. I don't think the 21 year old me would get hired at a tech company right now. I didn't have a portfolio, no experience in DS/Analytics/Statistical Modeling, and no family connections in the industry. A friend who was a year ahead of me in college was already working for the startup as an Engineer and since he knew I was ""mathematically gifted"" (his words, not mine), he got me the job. I learned everything on the job from SQL, SAS (yes, I'm that old), and even Excel. However, with DS and ML becoming the new gold rush, companies, especially tech companies, doubly so for FAANGs are spoiled for choice. So it's important to stand out. I've done a lot of hiring for FAANGs, so I feel like I can pass on some advice. As with anything on the internet, please take this with a grain of salt because this is only based on my experience, and isn't meant to be universal. For folks who're fresh out of school/still in school - internships help a lot. But in the absence of industry experience, the thing I look for is your ability to solve open ended problems using DS/ML. Kaggle competitions like predicting the survivors of Titanic have been done a million times over and don't show anything that I haven't already seen. So pick a problem in a domain that you think is interesting and do something DS related, like building a cool Data Viz, or building a model to predict/explain something, etc. For the more experienced folks, highlight the impact of your previous work. This leads neatly into my second point.

2. **Impact not method:** Unless you‚Äôre working in the research arm of tech companies (MSR, Google Brain, FAIR), or in Academia, your boss‚Äôs boss likely doesn‚Äôt care about what method you used to solve the problem. Just what the impact to the company was. So stop focusing on methodology and start focusing on how you‚Äôre helping the business. Remember that you‚Äôve not been hired to write SQL and Python, you‚Äôve been hired to help do one of: (a) make more money for the company, (b) cut costs for the company - which also includes helping others in the company be more effective by building internal tools. However, it‚Äôs relatively unheard of to have an entry level DS being given an open ended problem and being asked to solve it, you will likely have to rely on your manager and/mentors to do that for you. But over time, the expectation is for you to become more and more independent. Which would require you to constantly learn new things and adapt to change. Keep in mind that this doesn't mean you should stop paying attention to using the right methodology for the right problem, but that when you're telling your story, focus on the impact.

3. **Getting promoted:** Unless you‚Äôre exceptionally talented or exceptionally lucky, promotions won‚Äôt happen without asking for it. Have open and honest conversations with your manager about the expectations for the next level and chart a course to get there. Ask for feedback and continuously improve. As you grow in your career, especially past the *Senior* level, your ability to influence your peers, and leaders matters a lot more than your technical competency. So identify areas where you can exercise that muscle. It‚Äôs very different muscle from being a technically capable data scientist. A mistake I see a lot of young Data Scientists making is relying on the idea that more work will get you promoted. It won‚Äôt, at least after a point. What it takes to go from L3 (entry level) DS to L4 (the very next level) is very different from what it takes to get to L5 (Senior) and above. 

4. **When moving companies, know the levels:** I got seriously burnt in my last role. I misunderstood their leveling system and took a role at a level below my expected level, became seriously resentful at seeing people with half my experience being in the level above me, eventually ended up leaving because I thought it was a clear case of bait and switch. So do your research, talk to people in the company if you can. levels.fyi is a great resource to understand level equivalence across companies.

5. **Find a mentor, then mentor others:** If your company has many Data Scientists, find someone who you look up to and ask them to be your mentor. Go prepared to your mentorship sessions, ask pointed questions and ask for their advice. More importantly follow-up with them and show how their advice helped you. Once you're comfortable enough, pass on the favor to those who come after you. If you're the only DS in a company - which I've seen cases of, find industry mentors. I've seen many forums for you to find DS mentors. If nothing works, reach out to people in the industry on LinkedIn asking for mentorship. More than half the time, they will accept.

6. **Strike a balance between technical skills and soft skills:** As I mentioned above, the further you get in your career, the less important your technical ability becomes. That doesn‚Äôt mean you can afford not to know the basics, it just means you‚Äôre valued more for your ability to influence your peers, stakeholders, and leaders than your ability to write beautiful code. So learning after a point has to span both the (almost orthogonal) axes of technical ability and soft skills. You cannot afford to be lax on learning new techniques because the world around us is changing. I started my job knowing only SQL and SAS. Then my toolkit was SQL, SAS and R. I only picked up Python ~2-3 years ago. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs not gonna end here. Learning is a lifelong endeavor in a field like this. At the same time, I was also learning to be a better negotiator, and a better leader. 

7. **Focus on quality of life:** Remember that I have had over 12 years to do this, and I‚Äôm not even half-way into my career. Careers span 30+ years. Learn to take a breather, take vacations, take breaks and disconnect from it all once in a while. An endless rat-race will leave you burned out and unable to focus. It happened to me 5-6 years into my career where I felt overwhelmed everyday. It‚Äôs not good for you in the long run. I know this point sounds contradictory to everything I‚Äôve said above about constantly having to learn, but it really isn‚Äôt if you put it into a 30+ year time-span. You don‚Äôt have to be the best analyst, best machine learning engineer, the best story teller, and the best leader in year 2. You can pick and choose what you want to learn based on your environment and what‚Äôs needed immediately.

8. **Don‚Äôt gatekeep, don‚Äôt look down on others, help those who ask:** Nothing bothers me more than seeing young Data Scientists/ML Engineers looking down on Data Analysts, calling them SQL monkeys. A lot of them also look down on people who do sales and marketing. Remember, even in companies like FAANG, your ability to get paid ultimately depends on the marketing and sales people‚Äôs ability to sell the things you build. Work with everyone, help anyone who will ask, and be nice to everyone you come across. Being known as the person who is ‚Äúnice to work with‚Äù will take you much farther than being a 10x engineer (a term I‚Äôve come to loathe).

I‚Äôm happy to provide proof of my career to the mods, but also worried about getting doxxed. Feel free to ask me any questions, I‚Äôll be happy to answer them (within reason).",1

50,Experience/Advice from a 10+ year data scientist,846,iorbjg,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/iorbjg/experienceadvice_from_a_10_year_data_scientist/,87,"For context, I was in most people's shoes here so this is why I want to give back some advice and inspiration. There's a bit of misinformation in this subreddit so I'll consolidate my thinking. DM me if you need specific advice

Background:

1. Been working in quant/data science for 10-11 years now. Didn't know where to go because this field didn't exist when I was in school.
2. Self-taught. This is where my imposter syndrome appears but little did anyone know this. Learned SQL through sqlzoo, learned R as a hobby to day-trade (yahoo-finance api, zoo package, etc.), Python through codeschool(?) or codeacademy(?) in 2012 (it was free back then), Math through OCW/torrented whitepapers & textbooks, ML through whitepapers & textbooks (coursera did not exist yet)
3. Interviewed around a lot and got rejected a lot (100+). When I first began, this was not a field, but the interview process & rejections gave me grit and understand what to study. I interviewed for a lot of exciting startups (now public companies) before they were even big. A small hedge fund gave me a chance as a quant trader, and our group got shut down in a year. I got a second chance somewhere else and the company went public (data science was central to their strategy)
4. Data Science is exciting. This field has brought me around the world. Worked at a hedge fund, electricity markets, global consulting, somehow ended up doing A.I work, and now in a leadership strategy role. I don't oversee data scientists anymore, they mostly report to my business function now but previously managed 20+ data scientists.  Worked all over the globe and across many, many states. 

Advice:

1. Study and code everyday. Make it a habit. Blog posts, whitepapers, textbooks. I've lost this habit and I regret it -- getting back into it. You should love learning, otherwise you're in the wrong field.
2. Build up your foundations. Python/R, Probability/Stats/Calculus/LinAlg/DiffEq, Algorithms. This will help you understand a lot . Do take an algorithms & design course. Most problems are solved through a design approach / framework rather than a model.
3. Stay in touch with whats going on. hackernews/datatau/rweekly & understanding  new Data Engineering trends, Tech Engineering Blogs. Example, when I read some company blog about their implementation of spark in 2014, I immediately started playing around with it with my models.
4. Always be humble & prepare to get humbled but remain self-confident and determined. Don't be afraid.
5. Find a subject you like to get started. Loving data & modeling is one thing, but find an area that really interests you. For me, I started with time series (not for the faint of heart). This introduced me to a lot of difficult concepts.
6. Find a product/field. For me it was Energy & Finance. It can be marketing, sales, finance, pure ML, pure optimization work, supply chain, etc. Being a general hobbyist will only get you so far.

Lastly, Data science is not all SQL. It depends on how close you are to the revenue generating side. If you‚Äôre making a quarterly report on demand, that isn‚Äôt data science. If you‚Äôre building growth models to accelerate users on your platform that tie to scale and revenue. SQL will get your dad but still have to come up with model",0

Their twitter, medium and LinkedIn all have 10s of thousands of followers, each effusing praise on how amazing it is that they are making AI accessible. Their videos, tweets, and LinkedIn posts are just some well packaged b-school bullshit with a bunch of buzzwords.

I see many people following them and asking for advice to break into the field and they're just freely handing them away. Most of it is just platitudes like - *believe in yourself, everyone can learn AI, etc.*

I actually searched on forbes for ""AI Innovator of the Year"" and couldn't find any mention of this person. Forbes does give out awards for innovations in AI, but they seem to be for actual products and startups focused on AI (none of which this person is a part of).

On one hand, I want to bust their bullshit and call them out on it fairly publicly. On the other hand, I don't want to stir unnecessary drama on Twitter/LinkedIn, especially because they seem to have fairly senior connections in the industry?

**EDIT: PLEASE DON'T POST THEIR PERSONAL INFO HERE**

I added a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gfnax4/im_sick_of_ai_influencers_especially_ones_that/fpvvxsk?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) answering some of the recurring questions.

**TL;DR -** I'm not salty because I'm jealous. I don't think I'm salty because they're a woman, and I'm definitely not trying to gatekeep. I want more people to learn ML and Data Science, I just don't want them to learn snake oil selling. I'm particularly salty because being a snake oil salesman and a shameless self-promoter seems to be a legitimate path to success. As an academic and a scientist, it bothers me that people listen to advice from such snake oil salesmen.",0

53,My Giant Data Quality Checklist,820,fzweaf,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fzweaf/my_giant_data_quality_checklist/,58,"First - [I also published this on Medium if you'd prefer to read the full article there](https://medium.com/@TWB_BI/starting-a-data-quality-checklist-2d500e97ab5c),

Here's the list without all the intro BS. Please do comment if you have some items to add! :

# Chapter 1 : General Structure

* Is there an established map of the database?
* Is it visible to all users?
* Is there a public strategy of how it is tested for truth?
* Are there known party(ies) responsible for updating it when there are structural changes?
* How often is it updated?
* When is the next scheduled update?
* Is there a change log to track prior changes?
* Is there a group of humans you can go to with questions?
* Is there a group of humans you can go to with general conversational topics?
* The user list from a DBA is great for this.
* Consider having a monthly meeting and yearly summit per database. Remember, this is YOUR responsibility. Not the owner of the database.
* If the source of data is an application or form, is there a map from every entry field to the corresponding field in the database?
* Capacity / Uptime
* How concerned should you be with locking up the database with poorly written queries?
* Who do you go to when it is dead?
* Is the data backed up / archived anywhere?
* For how long?
* Do you remove old values from the production database after archiving?
* Are queries logged?
* How often is the database refreshed, if it is part of an ETL?
* Automatically check, at the appropriate time, if it has been updated. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably not updated.
* What is the official way to request access to the database?
* Is there a time-out process of old user ID‚Äôs?
* Have a plan in place for when an automated procedure‚Äôs stored credentials are suddenly invalid.

**Tables**

* Is there any rhyme or reason to the naming of tables?
* If there are very similar tables (ie. CUSTOMER, CUSTOMER\_NEW, CUSTOMER\_NEW\_NEW), do the alternates need to exist?
* Is this table ‚Äúone row that is constantly kept updated‚Äù or ‚Äúone row for each time the data changes‚Äù?

**Joins**

* Should there be at least one ‚ÄúChild‚Äù for every ‚ÄúParent‚Äù?
* Is there a maximum expected ‚ÄúChildren‚Äù for every ‚ÄúParent‚Äù?
* Should there be ‚ÄúChildren‚Äù who don‚Äôt have ‚ÄúParents‚Äù?
* Is every table relatable to every other table?
* On joining fields
* Do the field types match, or do you need to do a conversion?
* Queries / Processes
* Is the query properly notated?
* With the code removed, the notes should be copy and paste-able to a non-technical business partner.
* The notes should represent reality. Please.
* Is it possible to do an ‚Äúanti-query‚Äù?
* Reverse your filters, but mirror your production process. In high value pipelines, this can be a huge preventative measure for errors, and an easy way to provide ‚Äúfree‚Äù extra value.
* Is it possible to do the query by hand on a small subset of records?
* If so, do this periodically. Seriously. I know you got into this line of business to not do this stuff manually, but doing this periodically can help verify all systems are working properly.
* Is the process entirely automated?
* If not, don‚Äôt launch.
* This includes any of the tests below that say ‚Äúperiodically‚Äù, if possible.
* Is it possible to store the results of every query, along with a timestamp of run (especially as part of an ETL process?)
* Are you choosing a ‚Äúwhitelist‚Äù approach, or a ‚Äúblacklist‚Äù approach?
* If there are changes after launch ‚Äî will you be applying those changes to previous projects, or leaving them in place with old (and potentially inaccurate) data?

# Chapter 2 : Data Types

**All / General**

* Are null values allowed?
* Are the fields expected to change over time? If the answer is ‚Äúno‚Äù, take hashes of lines at the time of development and test periodically to see if they change. If the answer is ‚Äúyes‚Äù, take extracts with timestamps in the name and only use those (instead of production) for reproducibility.
* Expert level ‚Äî Create a X / Y grid of every field against every other field. Have all parties involved in development (especially the humans that are the source of the data) write assumptions and rules that come up in each cell (if this field is ‚Äúbeer‚Äù this other field should be ‚Äú$5.99‚Äù) Document all of these. If something looks wrong and the customer says ‚Äúthat‚Äôs ok‚Äù, DOCUMENT THIS. With audio evidence if possible. Video isn‚Äôt bad either.

**General Text (Free entry)**

* If there is a default size, why is the default size set to the size it is?
* Is the field having an identity crisis ‚Äî does it only contain integers, dates, locations, etc.? If so ‚Äî should it be converted to the correct type? What do you do with those that can‚Äôt be converted?
* Does the text contain invisible characters that will cause it to print strangely (line-break)?
* Does the text contain special (or international) characters? Should it? If you are planning on exporting to .csv downstream, are you removing commas upstream (or tabs, or pipes, etc.).
* Is there a list of ‚Äústop words‚Äù that should be applied? Especially inappropriate words. Don‚Äôt let an f-bomb get into a shareholder report.

**Categorical Text (Unique list of values)**

* Store the unique values at the time you are developing, and the counts of each value. Periodically test for new/missing values. Have a plan in place for when this inevitably happens.
* Periodically test for wild changes in distribution. Communicate these to anyone who will listen. This will make you a hero. Provide this list to stakeholders during development. This is always interesting, because often it is vastly different than their estimate.
* If there are multiple categorical fields, is there an hierarchy that is documented and should be followed (if veh\_type is ‚Äúcar‚Äù, then veh\_brand can only be ‚Äúaudi‚Äù, ‚Äúford‚Äù, ‚Äútoyota‚Äù etc.). Have a plan in place for when this inevitably breaks.
* Is the field indexed for fast grouping?
* If the values are text numbers (one, two, three) ‚Äî should they be converted to integers (1, 2, 3)?

**Boolean (True/False)**

* If these represent a ‚Äúswitch‚Äù in the process, should the downstream impact also be represented in data? (if override\_price=0 then discount\_price should never be null)
* Store the distribution at the time of developing, and periodically test for changes. Communicate these to anyone who will listen.
* Does True or False have a different name to you customers? IE, 0 = No Sale, 1 = Sale.
* What should you do with nulls, if there are any?

**ID (Keys, AutoNum)**

* Is the ID an AutoNum? If so, are there missing values?
* Is the ID a complex key? Do characters in the complex key relate to the data in any way? Periodically test that this remains true.
* Are duplicates allowed?
* Are you operating under the assumption that the ID for any given record will never change (maintaining an extract or join to a private table)? Have a plan in place for when they inevitably do.
* If you remove the ID from the equation, are there any two completely identical rows?

**General Number/Integer**

* Does null = 0?
* Are negative values expected?
* Are decimals expected? If not, is there rounding occurring upstream? What are the rounding rules?
* Is there a maximum/minimum expected value? Record the minimum and maximum value at the time of development. Periodically test to see if this record has been broken.
* Is there an expected distribution? Periodically test to see if this has changed.
* Is the number secretly categorical (only certain allowed values)?
* Does the number increase in steps instead of linearly (100, 150, 200, 250‚Ä¶)?
* Is the number secretly a phone number or postal code?
* Is there any chance that the number has been cut off to fit in a smaller field (I‚Äôm looking at you, Smallint)?
* Is any number field the result of math on other number fields (price\*tax=total)?
* Is there a business preferred format for showing numbers (commas, negative signs)?

**Currency**

* Is there an assumed currency? If not, is there a categorical field that will tell you what currency it is?
* If the record also has a ‚Äúcountry‚Äù ‚Äî does the currency match the country?
* Are you converting these currencies to a single currency downstream? If so, store the conversion rates at the time of development.
* Is there a maximum sane currency? Record the maximum and test frequently. Have a plan in place for when it is inevitably broken.
* Does null = 0?
* Does the value represent a ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù value, or a ‚Äúpoint in time‚Äù value (current price of product, price of product between 2018 and 2019)?
* Are there negative values? Does negative represent a debit or a credit to the company?

**General Contact Information**

* Is there a schedule for updating contact information?
* When was the information last updated?
* When was the information last successfully used?
* If you use this information for any purpose, store the information at the time of use, and the reason for use. If possible, get as many employees as possible to do this in the same location using the same format.
* Do any two customers have the same piece of contact information?
* Does any contact information match your own company/office information?
* Does any customer‚Äôs information match that of a current or former employee?
* Is there a no-marketing list that you should be aware of? Ask multiple people and get excited when there are multiple answers!

**Phone Numbers**

* Is there an assumed country code? If not, is the country code stored in another field?
* Do not assume the country of residence is the country code of the phone number.
* Does the phone number follow the rules of that country code?
* Is there an assumed area code?
* Is the area code a toll free area code?
* Is the area code a legitimate area code?
* Is the phone number stored as text?
* Is there any rhyme or reason to the formatting of the phone number? If it is text, is there a single format? What do you do with numbers that do not match that format?
* Is there a preferred format for displaying phone numbers?
* Are you removing ‚Äúbogus‚Äù phone numbers (All the same digits, counting up, etc.).
* If there is a dialer campaign that returns invalid phone numbers, is anything being done with that information?

**Mailing Address**

* Is there an assumed country? If not, is the country stored in another field?
* Is the address free entry text, or cleaned via a service?
* If it is cleaned, what happens to un-cleanable records?
* Is the Postal Code -> State/Region -> Country strictly enforced?
* Is the mailing address in an expected area of business?
* Is there an additional ‚ÄúAPT‚Äù or ‚ÄúPO BOX‚Äù field? Should you be aware of this?
* If there is a latitude/longitude field, does it match the address? Do many customers have the same latitude/longitude?

**Sensitive PII**

* Are these fields humanely appropriate for modeling or analysis (ethnicity, income)?
* Do you need to be aware of HIPAA guidelines?

**Financial Information**

* God help you if your company is storing unmasked financial information.
* Did two different customers make a transaction with the same credit card? Or the same last four digits and expiration date?
* See what your most popular card type is and and provide this to your marketing department if there is a clear winner, for use with reward programs.

**Date / Time**

* Is this a system recorded timestamp field, or human entry?
* Is the time being stored with an assumed time zone?
* Store the minimum date-time during development. Periodically check to see if this has changed.
* Are there any dates with missing information? For example, there are sales every day of February except the 12th.
* Are there records outside business hours?
* Are there any fields that look like they were entered before their timestamp (people trying to create records in the past)?
* Are there any dates that are in the future?
* Do you need to have a specific game plan for leap years?
* Do you need to have a specific game plan for holidays?
* When counting records by day or hour, are there any outliers?Communicate this to stakeholders as soon as possible. Check this frequently ‚Äî it‚Äôs valuable information and will make you famous when you catch something. Additionally, it will ruin your model if there was a rare event.
* If there are multiple date fields, should they have an order of operations (field2 should always be after field1).
* Does everyone know what ‚Äúbiweekly‚Äù means?
* Does everyone know what ‚Äúmidnight‚Äù means?
* Is there a business preferred date format?
* For forecasting purposes - keep a separate table telling you what dates to NOT take into account when training forecast models. IE - Hurricanes, marketing campaigns, giant international pandemics.
* Do you have a plan for daylight savings time?

The end! Thanks for reading through, and contributing more ideas. I will try to keep this list updated.",1

55,Data Scientist = Web Master from the 90s,799,j1q5w2,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/j1q5w2/data_scientist_web_master_from_the_90s/,77,"This is something I've been thinking for a while and feel needs to be said. The title ""data scientist"" now is what the title ""Web Master"" was back in the 90s. 

For those unfamiliar with a Web Master, this title was given to someone who did graphic design, front and back end web development and SEO - everything related to a website. This has now become several different jobs as it needs to be.  

Data science is going through the same thing. And we're finally starting to see it branch out into various disciplines. So when the often asked question, ""how do I become a data scientist"" comes up, you need to think about (or explore and discover) what part(s) you enjoy.

For me, it's applied data science. I have no interest in developing new algorithms, but love taking what has been developed and applying it to business applications. I frequently consult with machine learning experts and work with them to develop solutions into real world problems.  They work their ML magic and I implement it and deliver it to end users (remember, no one pays you to just do data science for data science sake, there's always a goal).

TLDR;
So in conclusion, data science isn't really a job, it's a job category. Find what interested you in that and that will greatly help you figure out what you need to learn and the path you should take.

Cheers!

Edit: wow, thanks for the gold!",1

I wanted to repost in case it was helpful to anyone. 


I work for a midsized SaaS company as an embedded and thought I‚Äôd share what we are really looking for! 
* **SQL**: For some reason, this is a huge hole. 90% of DS is data cleaning and manipulation. Don't just know the syntax; know how to manipulate raw product tables to get the data you want, and be able to defend your pulls to business line owners and stakeholders when they ask why you're showing them what you're showing them.  
* **Logic and self deduction skills**: I'm not just talking about math-like logic. This includes business and interpersonal logic as well. For example, why is this person asking this? What is the ‚Äúwhole board‚Äù they‚Äôre seeing?
* **Ability to check your data and findings against the product output / business situation**: How do you know what you pulled is right? That your findings make sense? Do your numbers hold water against someone who knows the product data and inter-workings inside and out? Can you explain your models?
* **Non technical stakeholder communication skills**: This includes presentations, building rapport and relationships, managing up, managing different attitudes, understanding perspectives, understanding how to ask questions and listen between the lines, building strong daily partnerships
* **Business strategy skills**: Now that you‚Äôve completed this project, now what? What does this mean for the business? How do you see the whole board and make a recommendation that fits in? 
* **Grit and attitude**: AKA the ability to wrangle through messy problem,  messy data, and with messy relationships and politics. Know how to get through the mess, how to self problem solve, and when to call in favors. Also, have a willingness to do grunt work, like write SQL, or figure out what the product data is, how it is produced, and wtf the engineers were thinking when they structured the product in that way.
* **Politicking and relationship building**: understand how to work with product, biz line owners, execs, etc to solve problems. Have a strong willingness to HELP OTHERS! 
* **Tableau / data viz in some way**: be able to clearly relay your findings, with ""like I'm 5"" attitude, to people who are not comfortable with even basic bar charts or graphs. You should be able to look at a graph at a glance and consume what it is telling you. 

Then... python/R, special packages, math, modeling, etc. 

I see so many people worried about x language or Y package, where I actually think those are relatively easy to learn. The soft skills aren‚Äôt taught in school and are VERY important - and the hardest to find! 

Honestly, analysts and data scientists don't get to do the cool stuff all the time. There is a lot of boring stuff that is easy to do, technically. I built a dashboard the other day that took me maybe 4-6 hours from start (coding) to finish, and people falling over themselves in excitement. It wasn't fancy, but it made it VERY easy for them to get what they needed, quickly. 

What do other hiring managers think?

**ADDITONS:**
* When all else is equal, we hire based on culture and team fit, and willingness to learn. **Attitude and fit often outweigh technical skills!**

* The requisite mastery level certainly does depend on the job level. For more junior level candidates, I understand when you haven‚Äôt developed those yet... but how is your attitude? Do you think you know everything bc you have the hard skills down? Or do you recognize that you are just starting out and the soft skills are what you need to learn? 

You‚Äôd be surprised at how many people graduate with a MS or PhD, but have no work experience, and think they deserve senior level roles. Sorry... drop the ego, you only know a little bit of what you actually need to know to be successful. 

* Re: how to convey this in an interview / resume, or how to ask interview questions - you ask performance based questions. ‚ÄúTell me about a time you partnered with a non technical stakeholder to solve a business problem‚Äù. 

Talk about how you solved the business problem first, then about the tools you used to get there. I like hearing about cool stuff, but I also need to know you can do the basic stuff and the soft skills REALLY well. 

* We hire for a well rounded team. Everyone has a different background. Not everyone is going to know everything. That is ok. Lean on what you're good at, have an attitude that focuses on continuous learning, and be a strong team player.

I have been browsing this and other related subs (r/cscareerquestionsEU, r/datascience, etc) for a long time now looking for advice on my journey to find a full-time job and our field in general. I graduated from my Master's program (major in ML, from a top tier university in Germany) this year in March and have been looking for full-time positions in the area for about 6 months now. Today I had a Zoom interview with a company (eCommerce) I had been in touch with for the past couple of weeks and about an hour ago, they called me saying they were really impressed and the job is basically mine if I want it. I am absolutely elated.

To give an idea about my job search process if it gives anyone a perspective being in a similar position, I applied for a total of 222 positions in the areas of Data Science, ML Engineering, Data Engineering, and a handful of Software Development positions as well (CV was same for every application and cover letter was modified a little bit depending on the company - in most cases, it was also the same. Perhaps that explains so many straight-up rejections).

**Ghosted:** 118.

**Outright rejections**: 68.

**Rejections after the technical stage**: 14.

**Still in the process** (applied less than 10 days ago and haven't heard): 22.

**Offers**: 2 (the other one is ML Engineer).

&#x200B;

I feel I am a little above average when it comes to programming but I do have a theoretical understanding of ML algorithms (master's helped), so that helped in some interviews. Regarding the choice between the offers, I feel I am gonna go with the Data Engineering one since there is a lot of room to learn new frameworks which I did not experience in academia (PySpark, Airflow, etc.), there is room to turn into a Data Scientist as the project continues and because the location is excellent.

There were a few days where I was really depressed about my rejections (especially when I got one or two emails in the morning) but I made myself resilient by thinking that the rejections don't matter much (especially the ones given without any interview) and kept on learning and applying. If you are in a similar position, keep on going. Things will turn for the better. :)

&#x200B;

EDIT: Just wanted to add a couple of things since this post is getting a bit of attention. I had a grade of 1.7/5 (in Europe/Germany, 1 is the best you can have and 4 is the worst; anything lower is failing) in my Master's. I had one and a half years of part-time working experience and I was a Teaching Assistant for two years for an ML/DL course in my program.",0

I've just spent the last 9 weeks building what I hope is the simplest way to scrape data from a webpage: [Simplescraper](http://simplescraper.io).

All you gotta do is click on the data you want, give it a name and then view results. If all goes well your data is waiting for you to download in csv or Json format. There's also cloud scraping built in for bigger jobs.

There are dozens of web scrapers out there but none of them seem to nail ease of use *and* a good UI. Hopefully it brings value to some of you ü§û.

Edit: Grateful for the positive response. The element/css selector still ain't 100%, tutorial videos need to be created and there's still more than a few bugs - all will be improved in the next version. I've removed the limit from cloud scraping until the weekend so it's infinite credits for errbody. Throw whatever you have at it! And if you find a page where the extension just utterly fails do let me know in the comments and I'll get to it.",0
81,"So many people disappointed with their jobs. You need to manage your expectations, especially if you're very junior.",684,gv3i57,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gv3i57/so_many_people_disappointed_with_their_jobs_you/,92,"&#x200B;

I keep seeing threads on this forum about how disappointed so many people are with their data science jobs.

&#x200B;

I think expectations need to be managed, in any line of work:

1. **Seniority / juniority**:  When you start as a medical doctor, you won't start by diagnosing Dr. House-like rare, life-threatening conditions straight away. If you join a law firm, you won't start by passionately and single-handedly defending your clients in court like in a John Grisham book. If you join Goldman Sachs as a graduate, you won't start by managing multi-billion trades and investments straight away. **Any job has a certain amount of grunt work, which is greater at the very beginning of your career**. The world is full of bright kids disappointed with their first jobs, wondering: ""did I really study 3/4/5 years to change the colours of a PowerPoint slide?"".
2. **Importance within the organisation**: this varies wildly from place to place but, generally, regardless of the guff HR says, in many organisations there is a clear difference in the food chain between the functions which are seen as generating revenues and those which are seen as support functions. In many places, the sales team (or equivalent) brings home the money, and everyone else is seen as a support function. You don't need to argue with me that this is shortsighted: you need to understand that this attitude is common, need to do your homework on what the culture is like before joining a company, and make your decisions accordingly.
3. **(related to #2): what is the background of the senior people?** If you are a data scientist in a company where most senior executives have some kind of technical background, you are more likely to be appreciated than in a company where the senior guys (it's almost always guys...) are all salespeople who go into sensory shutdown the moment you mention anything more complicated than the times tables.
4. **what are the real needs of the business?** Even in the most enlightened organisation, with the most technical sensible competent open-minded etc etc executives, **there will be more need for boring work than for exciting, cutting-edge work**. For every person that must do proper R&D and brand-new, cutting edge models processes technologies etc, there will need to be many more people that must manage and maintain the existing processes and models, which is important even if less interesting",1

Yes, I use python for my job. That doesn't mean any test that employs python is a relevant assessment of my skills. It's a tool, and different jobs use different tools differently.

87,Why the ability to concentrate is the most important skill in 2020,649,hecc72,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hecc72/why_the_ability_to_concentrate_is_the_most/,108,"Many of us usually have at least one thing that we know we need to do. And if somehow we managed to sit down and do it from start to finish. Our life would be better because of it. The problem is that people put off that thing, they do anything under the sun to distract themselves.

Being a person who naturally gets distracted easily and was surely one of the worst procrastinators. I can confidently say it's never too late to make a change. Because if somehow even I managed to find little strategies and create little short cuts to become someone who can concentrate for long periods of time. Then you can too!

\#1 Why it's so important?

First of all, it's probably not a secret that getting sidetracked nowadays is easier than ever. We are constantly bombarded with ads and online marketing. In fact, according to research, it takes around 15-20 min. to get back to your 100% concentration after getting distracted. Basically, if we cut to the chase - this new distracting digital age creates a huge demand for people who can resist distraction and concentrate.

2#The bar is so lower than you think

If you can dive in even for one hour on your most important thing for the day with a ruthless and intense focus. You will make substantial progress in your life. And as you get used to that hour of concentration. You can upgrade that to 2 or 3 hours. Just think how much intense focus that is. You will skyrocket past your goals!

3# Guilt-free pleasure and balance

I know that many of us want to have a balanced life. We want to achieve something or do something meaningful but still enjoy life. For example, maybe you want to work on your personal projects, but at the same time, you don't want to give up video games. This was one of the biggest pains I struggled myself. I would play a lot of video games but then at the same time I would feel guilty for not making progress on my personal goals. And it's funny because the solution is so simple. You can play the crap out of those video games after you put a tremendous amount of focus on something else. This way you don't feel guilty and can fully immerse yourself into video games.

And if the perks of mastering concentration don't entice you, you can stop here...

91,Keep a Brag Document,636,h96nz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/h96nz8/keep_a_brag_document/,30,"Hi everyone,

Thought I'd share some advice that has helped me so far in my Data Science career. It has to do with recording your wins at work - hope you like it!

\-----

The human brain is terrible at remembering information.

When we try to use the past to predict the future, we end up using *our memory* of the past. And our memory is extremely flawed, subject to whims and emotions.

One of the biggest consequences of this is at work.

You clock in 9-5 for days on days and then when you look back at what you did a year ago, you think ‚ÄúWhere did all that time go?‚Äù

Even worse, if YOU can‚Äôt remember what the hell you did, how will your boss?

In an ideal world: you do a great job, your company rewards you. They‚Äôll notice all the hard work you‚Äôre putting in. All the beautiful lines of code you‚Äôve written.

But we don‚Äôt live in an ideal world. And the costliest mistake you can make in your career is not being proactive about recording your achievements and your little wins.

**Enter The Brag Document**

I first read about a Brag Document on [Julia Evan‚Äôs blog](https://jvns.ca/blog/brag-documents/#template).

By recording your small wins and accomplishments on a weekly basis, you accumulate concrete evidence of what you‚Äôve achieved.

And these ‚Äúwins‚Äù don‚Äôt need to be Olympic Gold Medals.

Did you help a coworker understand how to use an API? Jot it down.

Did you anticipate a nasty bug and proactively reach out about it? It goes on there.

Did you help mentor a junior employee? That‚Äôs definitely part of it.

Over time, I promise you, your brag document will do wonders for your career.

Sure - negotiating a raise or getting a promotion will become easier. In fact, come performance review time, even your boss will thank you for it. Those things are hard to write from pure memory. More on this a bit later.

But the biggest benefit of a brag document lies in identifying *what you enjoy doing*.

Your wins are likely a representation of tasks you enjoyed. And you should be very proactive about focusing on those tasks going forward.

Use your Brag Document to ruthlessly identify the tasks you want to spend more time on, as well as the tasks you don‚Äôt want to do anymore.

**The Pareto Principle**

The Pareto Principle states that 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.

At work, 80% of what you can feel proud about will stem from 20% of what you do. You can think of your Brag Document as representing that 20%.

Use this 20% to ask yourself questions like:

* Is there a common theme amongst this work?
* Are there topics here that I thought I didn‚Äôt actually like but turns out I do?
* How much of this work involves collaboration with other departments / teams?
* How can I do more of this work?

**Frequency**

Update your brag document on a weekly basis. You can set it as a recurring event on your calendar.

The biggest benefit of this is that it forces you to scrutinize your output on a regular basis and allows you to be proactive about focusing on the work you want to do.

Let‚Äôs say that after a few weeks of work, you genuinely have nothing to put on your brag document.

There‚Äôs a chance you had a bit of a slow period at work, but maybe you‚Äôre just stuck somewhere you don‚Äôt want to be?

**Collaborate**

Talk about your brag document with co-workers. Ask them what you think you should put on yours.

You‚Äôll often find that they‚Äôre able to mention things you completely forgot or didn‚Äôt even seem to think about.

Remember - just because something seems easy *to you* doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs easy in general. 5 minutes of work may have taken you 10 years to learn.

You should also encourage your team to keep their own brag documents. Help each other be accountable and celebrate each other‚Äôs wins. This builds a strong team culture.

**Your Manager**

You should try to share your brag document with your manager once a quarter.

It might seem **weird** or **unnatural** \- you‚Äôre basically dumping all your achievements into their lap. But this actually really makes their life easier.

If your manager ever needs to vouch for you internally, then boom - they have direct evidence they can use. If your manager needs to reshuffle workload, then they know what you‚Äôre good at and what you can improve on.

Even better, you and your manager should go through your brag document together.

Tell them what you want to do more of. Tell them what you wish was on there more.

You‚Äôll both be able to identify areas in which you‚Äôre doing a great job and also areas in which your manager perhaps wants you to focus on more.

Another aspect that‚Äôs helpful here is with goal setting - your manager and you likely work together anyway to determine quarterly goals.

You should use your brag document to help you identify what type of goals you need to be hitting. Very often, we will achieve goals and then think ‚ÄúWait..what was the point again?‚Äù

By using your brag document to set goals, you‚Äôll be much more likely to be working towards something that you find rewarding.

**Ending thoughts**

Once you start getting in the habit of using a brag document, operating without one will feel like doing your work in the dark.

Over time, you‚Äôll develop a much clearer picture of the type of work that you want to focus on for your career.

92,What makes a good personal project - from the perspective of a hiring manager,633,gf9hrs,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gf9hrs/what_makes_a_good_personal_project_from_the/,57,"We often see the question on this sub around ""how do I build a portfolio as a student?"", i.e., what projects should I work on?

If the resumes I've reviewed over the last 5 years are any indication, most people seem to think that the answer is a Jupyter Notebook that takes a pretty standard dataset, does EDA, builds a model, and presents a bunch of plots showing quality of fit.

From my perspective, these projects are pretty much useless. I say that because odds are that I can figure out if you can build such a notebook by just asking you a handful of questions and spending 5 minutes talking to you. Most importantly, being able to do that for a project that you chose (whether personal or capstone project) makes this project worthless in terms of helping me evaluate how you overcome obstacles - odds are that the way your overcame obstacles was by choosing a project that was easy to do and had relatively clean, available data.

So how do you make a better personal project?

**Start with a problem statement that is actually useful, even if you don't know how to solve it**

As a rule of thumb, an imperfect solution to a useful problem is better than a perfect solution to a useless one. I'd rather see you build a linear regression model to solve something that people actually care about instead of building a deep learning model to predict Titanic deaths. Why? Because problems that matter show a hiring manager that you can think through how to use data science to drive value. And if the process of getting there sends you down some windy roads, it also shows the hiring manager that you're able to navigate them. These are two *really* important skillsets.

Mind you, when I say ""useful"" I don't mean ""important"". I'm not telling you that you need to go find a cure for cancer, just to focus on something that *someone* will find a user for.

Example:

* Building a  model to optimize a fantasy football lineup.

Again, not important - just useful.

**Focus on a problem that goes beyond predicting a single metric**

A lot of data science ""side projects"" that I see focus on predicting a single quantity. While sometimes you will find yourself doing that in a work setting, most of the time your work goes beyond that, meaning you are normally predicting a quantity so that you can then influence a decision process, or estimate a broader outcome, etc.

So if you're going to work on a side project, try to follow through your model ""all the way"", i.e., through to an actual outcome that could be useful.

Example:

* Don't just predict the number of points a player will score in fantasy football - actually build that into a model that can help someone make decisions in a more complex setting (like daily fantasy football, or evaluating draft strategies).

**Start with ugly, raw data if you can**

If you start your project with mostly clean, post-processed data you've already skipped a big step in terms demonstrating what you can do. If instead you choose to go for something that isn't in its final form, you can flex a couple of different muscles.

For example, you could scrape data. Not super complicated, but it already shows me an extra skillset. Or you could start with data in log format and writing the necessary scripts to convert it into tabular form.

Example:

* Instead of starting with aggregate NFL stats, start with NFL play-by-play logs and write a script to convert ""S.Barkley runs for 10 yard loss PENALTY Holding: NYG REJECTED"" into the appropriate statline.

**If possible, build an actual product - not just analysis**

Building a product allows you a couple of advantages. For one, it allows you to just share a link to something that people can actually use. Secondly, if your tool were to get any traffic, it allows you to validate your idea. Lastly, it allows you to flex a completely different muscle - the fact that you can think through basic (or advanced) designs and deploy a solution to an environment.

Example:

* Build a web-app where people can make selections and your tool will output a recommended lineup in fantasy football.

**Work alone**

One of the big issues with group projects outside of a work setting is that it's hard for a hiring manager to corroborate what you did personally vs. what others did. That means that some hiring managers may just choose to assume that you didn't have a part in all of it - and worse, that you don't have all of those skills.

If you work by yourself, you can guarantee that an interviewer will assume that you did all of it, and there will be no questions of what you can/cannot do.

Some may say ""but group projects show that I can work in a team!"". And I think everyone that has ever worked in a group project knows that they seldom punish the person in a group who most lazy and hardest to work with. 

Obviously this is just my opinion, but since the topic comes up often I figured it was worth putting it down to at least start a conversation.",0

94,How I went from no coding or machine learning experience to data scientist job offer in 20 months. [x-post r/learnprogramming],629,713hnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/713hnw/how_i_went_from_no_coding_or_machine_learning/,106,"TL;DR: learned a buncha shit in 20 months with no prior anything-related experience, got job as data scientist

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


Edit: Seems like this was removed from r/learnprogramming. Trying to direct all the PMs to come here

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


First, I want to thank the entire reddit community because without this place I wouldn‚Äôt have went down the rabbit hole that is self-learning, job searching, and negotiation. 

&nbsp;


Second, just to list out my background so people know where I started and how I got here: I graduated in 2013 with a bachelor‚Äôs in civil engineering (useless in this case) and again in 2015 with a master‚Äôs in operations research (much more useful, namewise at least) both from the same top school. The name of the school and the operations research degree opened up quite a few doors in the beginning of my (2-year) career, and definitely was a factor in getting an interview, but had nothing to do directly with what was needed for the Data Science job. This is because that offer was contingent on a programming skillset and specific data science problem-solving abilities, of which I had none right after graduation.

&nbsp;

The most useful advice to keep in mind: keep trying, keep learning, don‚Äôt be afraid to switch jobs when you‚Äôre bored or it‚Äôs not what you want, continuously look for new opportunities, and always negotiate. I went from a 47k job where I lasted only 4 months, to a 65k job where I lasted just under a year, to a 90k job where I stayed 10 months, to my new job at 115k. All in under 2 and a half years. Strap yourself in, this will be long!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**Step 1:**


Get your first real job out of college, realize how much you loathe it, feel entitled because they‚Äôre not paying you for your amazing theoretical prowess that isn‚Äôt really useful, realize that you were meant to do much more cool shit, and convince yourself that you need a higher paying job.


My first job out of grad school lasted 4 months. It was an analyst title, which I thought was awesome because I had no idea what analysts do, but it was mostly bitchwork and data entry. The one upside was that my boss mentioned a pivot table once, and I googled it, so I finally learned what it was. But I still figured I was too smart for this shit so I looked for other jobs because I needed something to challenge me.


Congrats, you now have the drive to get your ass to a better role!


&nbsp;


**Step 2:**


I got into the adtech industry after my 4-month stint, they liked me because of that pivot table thing I learned to do /s. This is where the data science itch began, but I knew I wouldn‚Äôt be satisfied in the long run. As pompous as it is to keep saying I was too smart for this shit, I was. I just needed the tools to show that.


The amount of data that lives in the industry is insane, and it‚Äôs always good to mention how much data you‚Äôve worked with. This place is where you earn your SQL, Excel, and Tableau medals. You edit some dashboards, you pivot and slice data, you don‚Äôt necessarily write your own complex queries from scratch but you know how they look like and know what joins do.


By no means was I going to do any advanced stuff at work so I needed to start doing it on my own if I wanted to grow. In my time at this job (after work but also during work. Use your down time wisely!), I took MIT‚Äôs Intro to Comp Sci with Python, Edx‚Äôs Analytics Edge, and Andrew Ng‚Äôs Machine Learning. This set up the foundation but since they were all intro courses, I couldn‚Äôt apply the knowledge. There were still a bunch of missing pieces.


But! At least I got started. Towards the end of my time there I found rmotr.com through reddit. I finished the advanced python programming course, which was incredibly difficult for me at the time because of the knowledge density and intensity. I highly recommend it if you want to learn more advanced python methodologies and applications, and also if you‚Äôre leaning towards the development side.


&nbsp;


**Step 3:**


I left my last company of a few thousand people, where everything was essentially fully established, and moved to a smaller company of 100ish people. There was more opportunity to build and own projects here, and it‚Äôs where I earned my dev, analytics, and machine learning medals. This is where classes will continue to aid in your learning, but where google and stackoverflow will help you actually BUILD cool shit. You will have thousands of questions the classes won‚Äôt be able to answer, so your searching skills will greatly improve in this time.


During my time here I completed Coursera UMichigan‚Äôs Intro to Data Science with Python. I completed it relatively quickly and from what I recall, it wasn‚Äôt too challenging. 


After that course, I stumbled on Udemy and completed Jose Portilla‚Äôs Python for Data Science and Machine Learning bootcamp, which was a turning point from knowledge to application. This class is a must. It‚Äôs how I learned to neatly organize my data frames, manipulate them very easily, and, thanks to google and stackoverflow, how to get all that data into csv and excel sheets so I can send them to people. It doesn‚Äôt sound like much, but data organization and manipulation was the #1 worthwhile skill I learned. It‚Äôs also where I learned to implement all machine learning algorithms using scikit-learn, and a bit of deep learning. There wasn‚Äôt much theory behind it, which was perfectly fine, because I was going for 100% application.


This is also where I took advantage of the training reimbursement at work- I kept buying courses and it was free! During this time I also completed Stanford‚Äôs Statistical Learning course on their Lagunita platform (good for knowledge base), the first three courses of Andrew Ng‚Äôs Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (it was a breeze because it was in python and I had a deep understanding of dataframes by this time, also very good for knowledge base and algorithm implementation from scratch), and another Udemy class from Jose Salvatierra called the Complete PostgreSQL and Python Developer Course- also a game changer. It was the first course I had on clean python code for software development. The way he thinks is outstanding and I highly recommend it.


&nbsp;


**Step 4: Resume Building and Linkedin**


There are articles out there that can explain this a lot better than I can, but here were my steps to have my resume and Linkedin Ready:


*Resume*


1.	Kept the resume to one page, had it look more modern, sleek, and fresh (even had dark grey and blue colors) 

2.	Under my name, listed my email, number, github, and linkedin across the entire width of the page


3.	Recent work experience on top. Descriptions included what technology I used (python, impala, etc.) to do something (built multiple scrapers, python notebooks, automated reporting, etc.) and the effect (saved hours of manual work for account managers, increased revenue day over day by X, etc). This can be easily remembered by saying I used X to do Y with the Z results.


Note: Not all of my descriptions had results. My last listed job on my resume only had the support work I did- I supported accounts totaling X revenue monthly, partook in meetings with clients, etc. Not every task has a quantifiable outcome but it‚Äôs nice to throw some numbers in there when you can.


4.	I read in some places that no one would care about this, but I did it anyway, and listed all courses and bootcamps I had finished by that time, which was around 8. While I had some projects I had done at work I could speak to, I wanted them to know that I was really dedicated to learning everything I could about the field. And it worked!

5.	Below that was my education- both degrees listed without GPAs


6.	And lastly, active interests. Maybe old-school corporations don‚Äôt care for things like this, but for start-uppy tech companies that are in a growth stage, I figured they‚Äôd like to see my what I do on the side. I‚Äôve been competitively dancing for almost a decade and weightlifting for more than that, so if being a dancing weightlifting engineering-background guy makes me seem more unique, I‚Äôm going for it. Whatever makes you stick out!

*Linkedin*

1.	Professional-looking photo. Doesn‚Äôt have to be professional, just professional-looking.

2.	Fill out everything LinkedIn asks you to fill out so you can be an all-star and appear in more searches. The summary should include a shitload of keywords that relate to what you‚Äôve done and what you want to do. Automation, analytics, machine learning, python, SQL, noSQL, MS-SQL, throw all that shit in there.


3.	I only filled out the description for my most recent job because that‚Äôs where I actually did cool shit. I put a lot more detail here in LinkedIn than I did on my resume. Then I listed the 3-4 jobs I had before that, no description

4.	Put all my certifications from the courses I took with links


5.	Put my education, obvs

6.	The rest‚Ä¶eh. Doesn‚Äôt really matter.


&nbsp;


**Step 5: Job Search**


So you have your nice and shiny resume ready, and your LinkedIn set to go. This is where the entirety of your hard work will be rewarded. How badly do you want this job?


I stopped using indeed, monster, etc. a long while ago. 


The single tool I used was and still is Glassdoor. Download a PDF copy of your resume to your phone or a cloud drive, search on Glassdoor ON THE DAILY. Keep saved searches ready to go- ‚Äújunior data scientist‚Äù, ‚Äúdata scientist‚Äù, ‚Äúsenior analytics‚Äù, ‚Äúsenior data analyst‚Äù, ‚Äújunior machine learning‚Äù, ‚Äúentry data science‚Äù, and so on. When you‚Äôre on the bus or laundromat or in bed late at night and can‚Äôt sleep, look for openings. Filter by the rating you‚Äôre willing to take on and apply like mad. I got dozens of applications done just from waiting at the laundromat. All the calls I had after were 100% from Glassdoor applications.


&nbsp;


**Step 6: The initial call**


I‚Äôve had 3 total initial calls from the probably 50 or so applications I sent over the summer (very few openings that didn‚Äôt require 5+ years of java and machine learning product dev etc. etc. and largely distributed blah blah where I live).


Here were most of the things I was asked:


‚Ä¢	What tools I used at work 


‚Ä¢	How have I made processes more efficient at work


‚Ä¢	Anything I‚Äôve automated 


‚Ä¢	Largest amount of data I worked with and what was the project and result


‚Ä¢	Why the shift from the current job


‚Ä¢	How much I know about their company and how I‚Äôd describe the company so someone else (do your research!)


I had 100% success on my initial calls. Each time mentioned some sort of python, automated scripts (simply by using windows task scheduler and batch file- thanks to google search!), and a data manipulation project (highest I‚Äôve had is a few million rows), and I was good to go.


&nbsp;


**Step 7: The data exercise**


From those 3 initial calls, I had 2 exercises sent via email and one via Codility.


The first exercise was SQL and visualization heavy. I was given a SQLite database to work from and had to alter tables to feed into other tables to aggregate other metrics and so on. Once that was done, I had to use the resulting tables to do some visualizations and inference.


Did I know how to do most of what they asked? Hell no. I had google and stackoverflow open for every little detail I didn‚Äôt know how to do off the top of my head. The entire thing took about 20-25 hours spread across the week and even when I submitted it didn‚Äôt feel complete. I couldn‚Äôt afford not to put all my free time into this exercise.


The end result: the hiring manager and team was impressed with the code, but they didn‚Äôt vibe with the presentation style of my jupyter notebook and it was very apparent that I lacked the domain knowledge required (this was for a health tech company, and I have no health anything experience). It actually prompted them to re-post with an altered job description requiring domain knowledge. Woo? Regardless, this served as a huge source of validation for me- these senior level members thought my code was good. 


The second exercise was from the company I ultimately accepted. It was 3-4 hours in total to assess business intelligence skills (SQL and visualization). They liked it and I moved on to the in-person, which I‚Äôll go into in the next step.


The last exercise was codility- and while my code ‚Äúworked‚Äù, there was likely some test cases I didn‚Äôt account for. Either that or the company got irritated when I said I received an offer and if they could speed up the process. They didn‚Äôt follow through.


&nbsp;


**Step 8: The in-person interview**


So you got to this stage! Congrats!


And you‚Äôll be interviewing with 3 VPs, 2 C-level execs, and 2 data scientists. Jesus fuck, you‚Äôve never met this many executives in your whole life.


No need to freak out. This simply validates your hard work. You‚Äôll be meeting with very important people for a very important job, and they think you might be good at it. 


Even if I hadn‚Äôt made it past this, I tasted victory.


I did something that may not be recommended by most people: I didn‚Äôt prepare for questions they‚Äôd ask me, but rather prepared for all the questions I‚Äôd ask them. This did two things: I didn‚Äôt obsess about what they‚Äôd ask me so I was relaxed, and it gave me a lot of chances to show I knew my shit when I asked them a bunch of stuff. Besides, for a data science job, I figured they‚Äôd ask questions about how I‚Äôd solve some problems they currently have, as opposed to some common questions. And that‚Äôs exactly what they did. Not something you can really prepare for the night before, since it‚Äôs a way of thinking you‚Äôd have to grasp through all the classes and projects and problems you solved at your current job.


IMPORTANT NOTE: I am not advocating ignoring prepping for questions. I did about 30-35 interviews, phone and in person, before my current job so I had a lot of learning experience. I already had a more natural-feeling response for most questions. And if you really were into your projects at your current job, you‚Äôll know what you did inside out, so it‚Äôs easier to talk about it on the spot. But by all means, if you don‚Äôt have much interview experience, prepare and practice!


Here are my notes from after the interviews, including what was asked and how I answered, and what I asked:

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP of Data Science**

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Notice any hiccup in your exercise?* I debated with him on the accuracy of a single statement in the exercise, assuring him that since I used a Hadoop-based query engine and they used AWS, my method worked every time I used it. I never checked whether he or I was right because afterwards I started thinking he was right and didn‚Äôt want to feel like an idiot. But we moved on rather quickly.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*How would you implement typo detection?* I gave a convoluted response but put simply, some distance index between words. As in, how many changes would it take to get to the word we may want. He liked the answer because it‚Äôs what he was thinking too.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*How‚Äôs your style of explaining things to people?* Very logical step-by-step process with the goal of weaning people off needing me. I‚Äôd explain it to them completely, then next time leave a few steps missing and ask if they‚Äôd remember, then eventually just give them a step or two.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What‚Äôs something you want to be better at?* Being more personable when explaining technical terms to non-tech people

&nbsp;

Then I went crazy with a ton of questions about what projects they‚Äôre working on, what‚Äôs the first thing I‚Äôd be working on, the challenges they have currently, how do they interact with the sales team, and so on.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Tech**

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*So, data! Tell me about it.* I told him that I love it, I‚Äôm excited by it, and I wana get better at it.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What as a process you made more efficient at work.* Created an automated process using a batch file to run python script via task scheduler. It scrapes an internal web tool and creates reporting that otherwise doesn‚Äôt exist, which saves hours for the account managers weekly.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*So you aimed towards a process that would essentially take something that‚Äôs not working too well, fix it, and productionalize it?* Why yes, yes indeed.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*So that kind of sounds like a software development mentality.* Absolutely, and eventually after I have a lot of exposure to the research side of data science I‚Äôd like to get more into a machine learning engineering role to build everything out.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Cool man!*

&nbsp;

He probably liked that I wasn‚Äôt purely analytics, but also built tools to solve problems not related to data science.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**COO, President** 


‚Ä¢	*What are areas do you think you need development in?* Being more on the business side of things, as I tend to like delving deep into my code to make things work I sometimes get delayed info of the overall business health.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Do you have any entrepreneurial experience?* I said nope, to which he responded with ‚ÄúNothing? Not even selling lemonade?‚Äù. Then it jogged my memory of when I tried to sell yugioh and pokemon cards at the pool when I was young, with my binder of sheets with prices too high so no one would buy. He had a laugh and said it was a good answer because the simple experience in learning the prices were too high was a lesson.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What are you looking for?* Something challenging, where I won‚Äôt be just a SQL monkey (this term was thrown around by a lot of the team, so I kept repeating it and made references to who mentioned it to show that I‚Äôm paying attention), where there will be big issues to solve across the company, and a place where I‚Äôd be doing something meaningful. In this case, it was helping local businesses thrive, and I‚Äôm all for that. I‚Äôm coming from an adtech background, so the emphasis was very clear on the ‚Äúfinding meaning‚Äù part.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*If that's the case, why this company?* I liked that they were VERY fast with their interview process. I told him that and that it shows a lot about the company and how much they care to get things done. 

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What was your proudest moment?* Told him about the first time I built a tool that helped the business, which was at my current company. The year or so of effort learning python and databases and manipulating dataframes led to a really cool scraping project that now seems rather novice, but I couldn‚Äôt contain my excitement when I accomplished it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Data Scientists**


Sit and chat. I asked them questions about how they like it there, what projects they worked on, etc. Very laid back.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**VP Marketing (first form)**


This was the one guy who really grilled me with problem solving questions. 

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Why did google decide to build out their own browser?* This is where my background in adtech helped. I listed almost everything I could about user data, selling to advertisers, tracking users, etc. He thought those were good answers, but it wasn‚Äôt what he was looking for. He asked me the next leading question.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What was so good about chrome compared to IE?* I stumbled on this since I never could really compare it fully to internet explorer since I never used IE, I just knew people said it sucked. With some guidance I answered correctly: faster load times.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*And what does that mean?* I took a few seconds of thought and answered correctly, that google wants their search pages to load faster.

&nbsp;

From there, he pulled some stats about google CPC and rates from another country and asked me how much would google make in capturing a certain percent of the internet explorer user market. My process was correct, but the multiplication was off in the end. A bit embarrassing, but at least I owned it and made some jokes about division by hand. Got the correct answer after.


That concluded the first in-person interview. Got called for another in-person and I was shitting myself because I thought maybe they didn‚Äôt get enough information. I was much more nervous for this one, but once the interviews started I was calm and confident.

&nbsp;

**CMO** 

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What are some of areas that you need development in?* Same as I said before- business side things.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Why the short tenure in your old jobs (4 months, 12 months, 9 months)?* THIS is where you have to show yourself as the ever-growing, constant-learning, autodidact with insatiable appetite to learn. I told him I learn on my own outside of work, I apply that knowledge to build cool shit, and that I outgrow my positions very quickly so I needed something more challenging. I backed it up with the projects I completed.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What'll be the biggest challenge you'll face here?* Data Science team structure- sprints, prioritizing the right projects, etc. Haven‚Äôt experienced it before so I‚Äôd have to learn how to operate within that structure.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What would your current boss say about you?* I explained that I have sort of two bosses, one tech and one nontech. The tech one would say I can take an idea and run with it to build a tool. The nontech would say I‚Äôm very helpful and available asap when he needs me.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What would they say you need improvement on?* Nontech boss- business side of things. Tech boss- get more into the details of adtech, like which scripts are executed on the page, how it relates to different servers, etc.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What would your last boss say about you?* Always learning on the job

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What's one example of when you thought outside the box?* Gave example of how the data engineering team was backed up and couldn‚Äôt ingest some third party data, so I used python to ingest the data 6-8 weeks before they could do it. I also explained that while the process was essentially the same (extract, transform, load) I thought outside the box by not relying on the team assigned with the task and figured out my own way to do it. He thought that was an excellent example.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What was your proudest moment?* Same answer as before

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Why the move?* Current company is pivoting, has been for 8 months but not much to show for it, a lot of senior leadership is exiting, not confident in the direction it‚Äôs taking, so figured this would be a great time to make a change.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*How would you describe your old bosses?* Last job- was first a coworker that was promoted to my boss. She was very kind, figuring out how to manage, but never lost sight of being compassionate and fighting for her team. Wonderful overall. Current job- nontech boss is very hands off since he doesn‚Äôt know the details of what I do, but gives good overall ideas. With tech boss, we work together constantly on data tasks or ideas for new tools to build. Very logical and unemotional at work, similar to me.

&nbsp;

After, I asked about what success looks like in the role and what were the biggest challenges facing his department.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**VP Marketing (final form)**


Here he was again! Back with more questions to grill me. I really liked the guy because he did his due diligence, and it was fun because the questions made my brain‚Äôs gears go overdrive.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*How would you go about seeing if users ordering from more than one location is profitable?* I responded with a very convoluted explanation for A/B test, which he said was good, then asked how to do it without the ability to do A/B test using data we already have. Was able to eventually tell him something along the lines of a time series analysis involving control groups.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Walk me through how you'll implement A/B test.* Told him the basics, but that I haven‚Äôt done it in practice. Couldn‚Äôt answer his question about how long it should run for so I told him straight up, and he was okay with it.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*How would you go about determining the optimal number of recommendations to show on the app for each geographical type?* Basic group-bys by geo and success rate for each number of recommendations shown.

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*What is logistic regression?* At this point I had just finished one of Andrew Ng‚Äôs deep learning course, where you code a logistic regression from scratch, so I did a little showboating here with how much I knew =D

&nbsp;

‚Ä¢	*Take me through the process of how you got into machine learning.* I told him basically what I‚Äôve described here- that I felt useless after my master‚Äôs, needed to not be left behind in the machine learning revolution, went crazy from day one and here I am.

&nbsp;

I asked him:


‚Ä¢	What are the projects I'll work on in the first month?


‚Ä¢	You worked at other huge and established companies, so why here and what makes you come back everyday?


And! I give you the absolute best question to ask:


‚Ä¢	‚ÄúYou‚Äôve had the most opportunity to get to know me and my skillset. I‚Äôd like to know if you had any reservations about my qualifications as a candidate so we can discuss and take care of any concerns.‚Äù


Boom! And just like that, I knew how impressed he was and that the only reservation was my short experience, but that I more than made up for it with my passion and drive. He almost didn‚Äôt want to say my lack of experience was a concern and looked very hesitant, I guess in fear of having me being like ‚Äúpeace!‚Äù


And that was that!


&nbsp;


**Step 9: Wait forever and get paranoid**


Title says it all. It‚Äôs hard to wait and wait especially when you felt like you did really well, and especially when the interviewing process took 3 weeks but the decision process takes another 3 weeks. My advice is simply keep applying to other places, don‚Äôt take your foot off the pedal, and continue learning/building things. I managed to finish another 2 courses from the time of the first interview to the offer, and even built my own small personal website. Don‚Äôt let up!


&nbsp;


**Step 10: Negotiate**


I‚Äôll leave it to you to gather more advice on negotiating and how to go about it, but my general advice is to always negotiate. Whether the market value is higher than the offer (I‚Äôm not a fan of this explanation but I‚Äôve never had to use it), or you suddenly feel that the responsibilities are worth more or, as in my case, you realize they don‚Äôt offer benefits you thought would be offered, then NEGOTIATE. It can be by phone or email, just do it. It‚Äôs uncomfortable, you‚Äôll question your decision every second of the day for what seems like forever, you think they‚Äôll rescind the offer and get someone cheaper. Just relax. It‚Äôs business. It‚Äôs part of showing your skills by not leaving money on the table. With a role as specialized as this where there is a lot of demand, you have the upper hand if you‚Äôve already proved yourself. I got a nice bump at my current job and at the new data science job by asking for more. I‚Äôll leave you this fantastic link that helped with a changing mindset:


http://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And that‚Äôs a wrap! A quick summary of the most important lessons I learned in this journey:


-	You don‚Äôt have to get an expensive Data Science degree or go to an expensive bootcamp. Everything is literally available for free somewhere online, and more structured resources are available at very low cost (Udemy and their $10 specials!)


-	Glassdoor is the most important app in this process. Download it, keep a fresh copy of your resume on your phone, and send out apps during your commute, at the laundromat, while in bed on a lazy Saturday, etc. It‚Äôs almost effortless


-	Absorb everything you can. A lot of it won‚Äôt stick, but a lot of it will.


-	Learning demands consistency. 10 hours of study spread across 2 weeks is much better than 10 hours you did that one weekend 2 weeks ago.


-	USE what you learn somehow- if you picked up python, google how to scrape the web, or how to automate sending files via email, or how to connect to a certain database. Make a project out of it, even a mini-project that you can speak about later. Google will show you the way! Optimizing processes is sexy and it was the most frequently asked question in this job search. 


-	In case you couldn‚Äôt tell, google and stackoverflow were lifesavers


-	Talk is cheap. A lot of people I know talk about taking classes and how excited they are. A year later they‚Äôre in the same place. Learn it, use it, and continue learning. Spend less time talking about how you‚Äôre gonna do something and work towards getting it done.


-	You‚Äôll stumble through a lot of material- and that‚Äôs okay. Not everything is connected in the beginning, and a lot of it will feel like wasted effort. Keep going! You‚Äôll reach the ‚Äúaha!‚Äù moment when everything clicks and you ‚Äúget it‚Äù. It might take a year and a half, but think about what would have happened if you started a year and a half ago?


-	Adding to the last point, it‚Äôs hard to know where to start and where to go. I‚Äôll summarize a cheap quick start guide for data science below if you‚Äôre lost!


-	Get ready to make sacrifices. On average it was 3-4 hours daily, everyday, before or after work, and sometimes 6 hours on each of the weekend days. And this isn‚Äôt counting the coding I did during work to make things more efficient, which is at least another 3-4 hours per workday. 


-	I did take about 6-8 weeks off in total throughout the whole process though. You‚Äôll burn out sometimes, and that‚Äôs okay! If you‚Äôre as driven and passionate as I was, you‚Äôll come back to it weeks later, maybe even a month.


-	Lastly, reddit is a place of vast knowledge of the field. Use it, go to r/learnprogramming or r/datascience or r/jobs or r/personalfinance. There will be questions and topics covering a lot of what I covered here.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;


**Quick start guide for data science:**


(in no particular order)


-	Introduction to Computer Science with Python from Edx.org


-	Either:


o	Andrew Ng‚Äôs Machine learning via coursera (not in python, but teaches you to know the matrix manipulation fundamentals)


o	Statistical Learning via Stanford Lagunita (more theory than programming understanding, but covers similar concepts, and introduces R which is also a good tool)


-	Python Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp via Udemy
Again, this is just to get started. Google and stackoverflow will take you to the next level and other courses will fill the knowledge gaps.

96,Advice for those entering the workforce: your job is not to be right - and it's certainly not to prove others wrong,618,edgai0,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/edgai0/advice_for_those_entering_the_workforce_your_job/,91,"Thinking back to my days as a first year data scientist, one of the most difficult transitions I've seen people make is how they measure their value.

Because academia is primarily an environment in which you're measured by how right or wrong you are, a lot of people transition into the workplace thinking the same. What's worse, some go further and extend that to the point of thinking that there is value in proving others wrong.

That is fundamentally not going to work. And that is because people in the workplace are measured almost exclusively on how productive they are - they are measured on results.

Corollary 1: if it's wrong but it works, then it's not wrong.

Corollary 2: if you're right but it doesn't change the outcome, then it doesn't matter.

Corollary 3: if you're right, but it doesn't work, then you're wrong. 

Corollary 4: if you prove someone else wrong, but their answer works and yours doesn't, then they're right and you're wrong. 

Corollary 5: if you prove someone's solution to be wrong even though it does provide value, then you have not yet provided any value until you propose something better. 

I cannot emphasize how much you can limit your career by focusing on right vs. wrong. Right vs. wrong is irrelevant; productivity always rules.

EDIT: Since many have had an issue with the definition of something that works vs. something that is wrong:

This is the part that people miss - it is rare that bad science works.

When things that a person sees as ""wrong science"" work, I normally find that the overwhelming majority of the time, if that person is junior, what is actually happening is that:

 1. It's not actually wrong, and the person just doesn't understand why it's right.

 2. It's not 100% right, but it's right enough to provide value. And some people interpret that to mean wrong, which is too binary in the world of modeling. 95% right isn't wrong, it's just 95% right. 

The only scenario where you will see bad science work with any degree of frequency is when it has been tested over too limited a set of scenarios - in which case it should be relatively easy to point out where it will fail, and then you can focus on outputs - on how it won't work, rather than on it being wrong.",1

105,Off My Chest. After almost 9+ face-to-face interviews I cannot even get a simple entry level Data Analyst job for almost 7 months now. Any advice?,596,gei64h,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gei64h/off_my_chest_after_almost_9_facetoface_interviews/,90,"I did my BSc in 2017, worked as a SQL analyst for 5 months and I completed my Data Science MSc end of last year. For a entry level analyst role I have the skills in SQL, Power BI, Excel, Python, I even did a tableau course on Analysis/ Data Science.  One of my concern is my in depth knowledge on the tools and programs above as I have no idea how to compare myself to another analyst.

I have a speech impediment which as expected gets worse during interviews as I have to think on my feet really quickly. I feel like I struggle with the competency-based questions, because due to my stammer I cannot use the STAR method correctly. Most of my feedback from the interviews were I wasn't the right candidate and other had fit the bill etc etc. ""you weren't confident, and they felt I wasn't strong enough"". I have never doubted myself nor have I lost confidence.

Especially during the lock-down, it‚Äôs hard for me to get an interview as most companies are closed and those that are still hiring start from a telephone call. In terms of landing an interview I have refined my CV with professional help and most interview reaches the face-to-face stage.

I am really afraid that I will slowly lose all my knowledge and programming and analytical skills which will cause me to lose an interview in the future. My goal is to be a Data Science in the future but I cannot even land a entry level Data Analyst position.

Would appreciate if you guys can answer these questions.

* What does an entry Data Analyst do on day to day basis?
* What skills do I need to polish?
* Are there any alternative ways to answer the competency-based questions?
* Any advice or suggestions

119,The Secret sauce to landing a data science role,539,d9a3o1,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/d9a3o1/the_secret_sauce_to_landing_a_data_science_role/,69,"I see tons of posts on here claiming specific technical skills needed to become a data scientist. As someone who conducts interviews, mentors new data scientists, and up-skills analysts and engineers, I wanted to offer my perspective. While I believe it is true that there are certain base technical skills required, I do not believe technical knowledge is what your interviewer is looking for, especially if you've made it to a conversational interview. 

The skills listed are merely talking points. Your interviewer most likely understands that you aren't currently an expert at every skill they question. They are likely interviewing you until they get to skills you are unfamiliar with. How do you respond when you don't know something? Do you admit it, or do you try and cover your competency? Are you defensive or are you curious? This is a continuous learning and feedback role. How have you identified, learned, and implemented a new skill? Are you even passionate about learning or are you obviously chasing titles, prestige, or salary?

They are looking for you to be confident in what you do and do not know. Do you boast algorithms and techniques you can't explain or worse, are you arrogant or elitist? Quickly in this role you will be presented with extremely ambiguous requirements. How comfortable are you with this ambiguity and how can you adapt or learn what is necessary to overcome and move forward with development? Will the team risk failure because you didn't speak up about your ability? Do you seek perfection and risk analysis paralysis, or do you iterate and experiment quickly? Are you someone who is a joy to mentor, support, and watch grow? Grit, growth oriented, self-aware, and an open-mind are qualities I consider essential. 

With the right mindset and support, the technical skills are not difficult to learn, especially with the pace of evolving tools. It's an investment the company should be knowingly willing too make. This mindset is what is hard to train for. 

Hope my advice helps. Good luck!",0

134,What hiring managers are really looking for,502,fvgx3n,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fvgx3n/what_hiring_managers_are_really_looking_for/,113,"I‚Äôve been following this sub for awhile, and am currently in the middle of a few hiring processes for data analysts/ scientists. I work for a midsized SaaS company as an embedded and thought I‚Äôd share what we are really looking for! 
* **SQL**: For some reason, this is a huge hole. 90% of DS is data cleaning and manipulation. Don't just know the syntax; know how to manipulate raw product tables to get the data you want, and be able to defend your pulls to business line owners and stakeholders when they ask why you're showing them what you're showing them.  
* **Logic and self deduction skills**: I'm not just talking about math-like logic. This includes business and interpersonal logic as well. For example, why is this person asking this? What is the ‚Äúwhole board‚Äù they‚Äôre seeing?
* **Ability to check your data and findings against the product output / business situation**: How do you know what you pulled is right? That your findings make sense? Do your numbers hold water against someone who knows the product data and inter-workings inside and out?
* **Non technical stakeholder communication skills**: This includes presentations, building rapport and relationships, managing up, managing different attitudes, understanding perspectives, understanding how to ask questions and listen between the lines, building strong daily partnerships
* **Business strategy skills**: Now that you‚Äôve completed this project, now what? What does this mean for the business? How do you see the whole board and make a recommendation that fits in? 
* **Grit and attitude**: AKA the ability to wrangle through messy problem,  messy data, and with messy relationships and politics. Know how to get through the mess, how to self problem solve, and when to call in favors. Also, have a willingness to do grunt work, like write SQL, or figure out what the product data is, how it is produced, and wtf the engineers were thinking when they structured the product in that way.
* **Politicking and relationship building**: understand how to work with product, biz line owners, execs, etc to solve problems. Have a strong willingness to HELP OTHERS! 
* **Tableau / data viz in some way**: be able to clearly relay your findings, with ""like I'm 5"" attitude, to people who are not comfortable with even basic bar charts or graphs. You should be able to look at a graph at a glance and consume what it is telling you. 

Then... python/R, special packages, math, modeling, etc. 

I see so many people worried about x language or Y package, where I actually think those are relatively easy to learn. The soft skills aren‚Äôt taught in school and are VERY important - and the hardest to find! 

Honestly, analysts and data scientists don't get to do the cool stuff all the time. There is a lot of boring stuff that is easy to do, technically. I built a dashboard the other day that took me maybe 4-6 hours from start (coding) to finish, and people falling over themselves in excitement. It wasn't fancy, but it made it VERY easy for them to get what they needed, quickly. 

What do other hiring managers think?

**EDIT TO ADD:**
* When all else is equal, we hire based on culture and team fit, and willingness to learn. **Attitude and fit often outweigh technical skills!**

* The requisite mastery level certainly does depend on the job level. For more junior level candidates, I understand when you haven‚Äôt developed those yet... but how is your attitude? Do you think you know everything bc you have the hard skills down? Or do you recognize that you are just starting out and the soft skills are what you need to learn? 

You‚Äôd be surprised at how many people graduate with a MS or PhD, but have no work experience, and think they deserve senior level roles. Sorry... drop the ego, you only know a little bit of what you actually need to know to be successful. 

* Re: how to convey this in an interview / resume, or how to ask interview questions - you ask performance based questions. ‚ÄúTell me about a time you partnered with a non technical stakeholder to solve a business problem‚Äù. 

Talk about how you solved the business problem first, then about the tools you used to get there. I like hearing about cool stuff, but I also need to know you can do the basic stuff and the soft skills REALLY well. 

* Re: starting my own business and my skill level - obviously I‚Äôm not 100% at all of these things. No one is! We all have areas to grow. Also, I don‚Äôt want to work on my own.

* Per a comment, I cleaned up my formatting :)

* We hire for a well rounded team. Everyone has a different background. Not everyone is going to know everything. That is ok. Lean on what you're good at, have an attitude that focuses on continuous learning, and be a strong team player.",0

&#x200B;

The Aftermath:

Yes, it‚Äôs a lot easier to get interviews and callbacks when you‚Äôve already got a data science job. That‚Äôs the good news. I don‚Äôt even consider myself a great data scientist, I‚Äôm probably 70th percentile at best. My GitHub is empty except for 1 side project I did 3 years ago. I don‚Äôt write cover letters. My professional network consists of lawyers and vagabonds. Turns out that‚Äôs enough! I turned down quite a number of interview requests and next steps. These were the most common reasons:

\-low pay

\-job was essentially product analytics

\-job was essentially software engineering

\-product or industry didn‚Äôt interest me

\-team was already quite mature, which makes it less exciting for me

The bad news is that it still takes a while to successfully secure an offer at a company that you actually want to work for. The challenge when you are an experienced candidate is no longer applying to jobs and hoping for a response. The challenge is carving out time (when you already have a day job) to conduct interviews and do take homes, and then hoping that you‚Äôre getting good vibes from the manager, the team, and the org at large. You now have the luxury of being picky about where you spend your time.

There are loads of companies who don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre doing when it comes to data science or ML, and only a handful that do, while also having an interesting product/challenges and good comp. Everyone knows who those companies are, so everyone who‚Äôs good applies to them, and so the competition is still pretty fierce at the highest levels.

Startups vs Enterprise:

There was an interesting split in terms of callbacks by company size and type. I received a grand total of 1 callback from an ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù company. The vast majority of my callbacks were from small-to-mid size companies that could colloquially be described as a ‚Äútech startup‚Äù or ‚Äútech-adjacent‚Äù, or through corporate recruiters who made first contact. After a while I stopped even applying to banks, media, insurance companies and any place that used legacy ATS software like Taleo or BrassRing (truly, the black hole of resumes). If they used Lever, Greenhouse or Jobvite instead, then I was golden. It‚Äôs funny to think that the course of your career could be so irrevocably shaped by shitty job posting software, but there you go.

Take Homes:

I don‚Äôt think anyone I know actively enjoys doing these but they‚Äôre apparently the new normal now so you gotta deal with them. The first few I did yielded poor results but over time I hit a nice groove. The key is to comment and explain everything you did (assumptions, reasoning, logic, commentary). My most successful take homes contained roughly the same amount of documentation as actual code.  I used the simplest methods I could because I didn‚Äôt want to spend a lot of time on these things, but I made sure to include a mini-report.

Something I Learned:

I eventually realized that the ideal interview process for me would frontload all the technical screening and reserve the onsite for conceptual or high level discussions.  Assign whatever coding screen, stats Q&A or homework you need before bringing someone in.  Ensure that everyone who makes it to your final round has already demonstrated sufficient technical chops.  There's nothing worse for a candidate than carving out a 4 hour chunk of time away from work, then showing up to someone's office just to flunk a whiteboard code sesh at the very top of the morning...and then having to interview for another 3 hours.  All it takes is one mistake and it could torpedo your chances.

Networking (bonus edit):

The thing with networking is that it works really well when it happens.  It's how I got one of my previous jobs: pretty much walked in for coffee and walked out with an offer.  Unfortunately, it's not a magic button you can just press when you need it.  There are a finite supply of senior DS jobs out there,, so you can't rely on it every time you need a change of scenery.  Definitely would recommend meeting people, getting your name out there, etc, but realize that it's more of a long term play than anything else.

Most Embarrassing/Annoying Moments (another bonus edit):

\-forgot how to write a window function

\-interviewer didn't believe common table expressions were valid SQL.  They totally are.

\-couldn't solve a string compression problem quickly/efficiently enough

\-blanked out on a binary search tree problem

\-couldn't quite explain how L1 regularization induces sparsity

\-""What is your greatest weakness?""  Seriously?

\-ghosted by the same company twice.  Fool me once...",1
142,100-days Data Science Challenge!,494,g20x47,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/g20x47/100days_data_science_challenge/,67,"One month ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fisj71/from_economics_to_data_science/) about starting my curriculum for DS/ML and got lots of great advice, suggestions, and feedback. Through this month I have not skipped a single day and I plan to continue my streak for 100 days. Also, I made some changes in my ""curriculum"" and wanted to provide some updates and feedback on my experience. There's tons of information and resources out there and it's really easy to get overwhelmed (Which I did before I came up with this plan), so maybe this can help others to organize better and get started.

&#x200B;

**Math:**

* Linear Algebra:
   * Udemy course:  [Become a Linear Algebra Master](https://www.udemy.com/course/linear-algebra-course/)
   * Book: [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Right-Undergraduate-Mathematics-ebook/dp/B00PULZWPC)
   * YouTube: [Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

I've been doing exercises from the book mainly but the Udemy course helps to explain some topics which seem confusing in the book. 3Blue1Brown YT is a great supplement as it helps to visualize all the concepts which are massive for understanding topics and application of the Linear algebra. I'm through 2/3 of the class and it already helps a lot with statistics part so it's must-do if you have not learned linear algebra before  


* **Statistical Learning**
   * Book: [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Application in R](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/data.html)
   * YouTube 1: [Data Science Analytics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCB2p-jaoolkv0h22m4I9l9Q/videos)
   * YouTube 2: [StatQuest](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtYLUTtgS3k1Fg4y5tAhLbw)

ITSL is a great introductory book and I'm halfway through. Well explained with great examples, lab works and exercises. The book uses R but as a part of python practice, I'm reproducing all the lab works and exercises in Python. Usually, it's challenging but I learn way more doing this. (If you'll need python codes for this book's lab works let me know and I can share) The DSA YT channel just follows the ITSL chapter by chapter so it's a great way to read the book make notes and watch their videos simultaneously. StatQuest is an alternative YT channel that explains ML concepts clearly. After I'm done with ITSL I plan to continue with a more [advanced book from the same authors](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/)  


**Programming**:

* I use the Dataquest Data Science path and usually, I do one-two missions per day. The program is well-structured and gives what you will need at the job, but has a small number of exercises. So when you learn something it's a good idea to get some data and practice on it. 
* Udemy: [Machine Learning A-Z](https://www.udemy.com/course/machinelearning/learn/lecture/6453704?start=0#overview)
   * I use their videos after I finish the chapter in ITSL to see how t code regressions etc. But their explanation of statistics behind models is limited and vague. Anyway, a good tutorial for coding
* Book: [Think Python](https://www.amazon.com/Think-Python-Like-Computer-Scientist-ebook/dp/B018UXJ9EQ/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2NDPR8R8GRQ8N&dchild=1&keywords=think+python&qid=1586982845&s=digital-text&sprefix=think+python%2Cdigital-text%2C139&sr=1-1)
   * Good intro book in python. I know the majority of concepts from this book but exercises are sweet and here and there I encounter some new topic.
* Leetcode/Hackerrank
   * Mainly for SQL practice. I spend around 40 minutes to 1 hour per day (usually 5 days per week). I can solve 70-80% of easy questions on my own. Plan to move to mediums when I'm done with Dataquest specialization.
* Projects:
   * Nothin massive yet. Mainly trying to collect, clean and organize data. Lots of you suggested getting really good at it, as usual, that's what entry-level analysts do so here I am. After a couple of days, I'm returning to my previous code to see where I can make my code more readable. Where I can replace lines of code with function not to be redundant and make more reusable code. And of course, asking for feedback. It amazes me how completely unknown people can take their time to give you comprehensive and thorough feedback! 

&#x200B;

I spend 4-5 hours minimum every day on the listed activities. I'm recording time when I actually study because it helps me to reduce the noise (scrolling on Reddit, FB, Linkedin, etc.). I'm doing 25-minute cycles (25 minutes uninterrupted study than a 5-minute break). At the end of the day, I'm writing a summary of what I learned during that day and what is the plan for the next day. These practices help a lot to stay organized and really stick to the plan. On the lazy days, I'm just reminding myself how bad I will feel If I skip the day and break the streak and how much gratification I will receive If I complete the challenge. That keeps me motivated. Plus material is really captivating for me and that's another stimulus. 

What can be a good way to improve my coding, stats or math? any books, courses, or practice will you recommend continuing my journey?

Any questions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome and encouraged! :D",0

Data Science Math Skills introduces the core math that data science is built upon, with no extra complexity, introducing unfamiliar ideas and math symbols one-at-a-time.

Essential Math for Machine Learning: Python Edition, Microsoft¬†(course)
This course is not a full math curriculum; it's not designed to replace school or college math education. Instead, it focuses on the key mathematical concepts that you'll encounter in studies of machine learning. It is designed to fill the gaps for students who missed these key concepts as part of their formal education, or who need to refresh their memories after a long break from studying math.

Mathematics for Machine Learning, Imperial College London¬†(specialization)
For a lot of higher level courses in Machine Learning and Data Science, you find you need to freshen up on the basics in mathematics - stuff you may have studied before in school or university, but which was taught in another context, or not very intuitively, such that you struggle to relate it to how it‚Äôs used in Computer Science. This specialization aims to bridge that gap, getting you up to speed in the underlying mathematics, building an intuitive understanding, and relating it to Machine Learning and Data Science.",0

1. Use arrows 
I tend to have so many hot fire ideas and solutions pouring out of my brain, Losing scope of a project. I remedied this by drawing arrows from IDEA to SOLUTION. Using my short attention span to my advantage, I could pour my mind out on paper and link those ideas to solutions, so whenever I need a structure, the arrows offer visual aid; removing the pesky anxious feelings. 

2. Writing diarrhea
Get everything out. When you‚Äôre flooded by thoughts, write down one word that associates with that thought. Keep going. You‚Äôll run out of things to write down. If some of these things make sense to you, refer to 1. And draw some arrows! 

3. Tree diagrams and prune
When you‚Äôre overwhelmed by what you want to do first, using your word diarrhea and arrows, build from those components. Look at those connections, what makes it achievable to go from a to b? Extend the edges from component a to all it‚Äôs children, likewise for b, c and so on. 
COME BACK TO IT AT A LATER TIME!!! This is important. Come back to your mess of words with structured arrows and begin pruning. You may realize that neural net you wanted to program uses too much time! However maintain the links from left to right, from idea to product. 
Here‚Äôs an example: 

Idea: I want to predict house prices, product: send as analysis tool to sales team. 

From idea
        Program in python
        Program in c++ 

From product 
       Deliver as REST API 
       Deliver as an excel spreadsheet with formula 


Now you come back at a later time. You notice that you don‚Äôt want to program it in c++, and you want to deliver it as a function for excel. Prune that tree. 

4. Meditate at work
Take time off to spend 10 minutes outside or in another room practicing your breath. Keep it simple, think of your breath and let your natural thoughts come in. Try to go back to your breath. 

These worked wonders for me. I spend every morning drawing arrows! We have trello to keep track of our projects, but I‚Äôd still get lost anyway. The visual aid of an arrow works wonders for me, and I honestly can‚Äôt explain that, however, try it for yourself. 

Writing things down feels like I‚Äôm taking a massive shit after a heavy night of curry, once it‚Äôs out I feel so relieved. 

I hope this helps, and if you have any

I'm one of the developers that have been working on a package that enables faster hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models. We recognized that sklearn's GridSearchCV is too slow, especially for today's larger models and datasets, so we're introducing [tune-sklearn](https://github.com/ray-project/tune-sklearn). Just 1 line of code to superpower Grid/Random Search with

* Bayesian Optimization
* Early Stopping
* Distributed Execution using Ray Tune
* GPU support

165,I got the chance to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team!,447,gtv2c9,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gtv2c9/i_got_the_chance_to_interview_a_data_scientist_at/,39,"Hey guys -

Had the opportunity to interview a Data Scientist at Uber on their Shared Rides Team. Thought I'd share some of it here, in case you find it helpful :)

**What do you do & where do you work?**

My name is Divyansh Agarwal and I am a data scientist at Uber in San Francisco. I‚Äôm working on  the Shared Rides business, and work on building products that grow the business. Some of my work also involves optimizing the efficiency of Uber‚Äôs ride sharing marketplace by improving graph optimization algorithms for rider-driver matching, and evaluating their performance via experimentation and simulations.

**When did you first become interested in Data Science?**

So, I had an interest in machine learning and predictive analytics before going into university. I wrote about it in my college essays as well.

But I was also interested in software engineering and fields like security. What really made me truly interested in data science was taking [Data 8](http://data8.org/) at UC Berkeley. I really liked the fact that you could use statistics to extract insights from data and provide value - and although I had always been aware of this, I only realized then how powerful statistics could be and how computing facilitates all of this.

After that, I started doing a bunch of projects, some internships, and got involved in research.

**When applying for jobs, was it hard to choose between going for a software engineering role as opposed to a data science role?**

Not really - I was always set on data science once I got into it. I used software engineering more as a backup, because given my CS background it would have been easy to get a software job if I just prepped hard for their interviews.

It‚Äôs actually harder to get a data science job out of undergrad. This is because there‚Äôs a general bias towards people with graduate degrees and people with a lot of experience. So you need to have either of both - either you need to have a lot of work experience, or you need to have a PHD.

So that‚Äôs why I built experience through doing projects, research, internships, etc.

For Data Science, there‚Äôs no real standardized process when it comes to interviewing - it varies a lot from company to company (this is in contrast to software engineering where using websites like LeetCode can get you ready for almost all jobs).

So I had to spend a lot of time prepping for each specific company I interviewed with - at every stage of the process - and this ended up taking a lot of time.

**When applying to Uber, did you have projects in mind you wanted to work on? How much did you know about the company?**

After my sophomore year of college, I was invited for this intern open house at Uber. That‚Äôs when I met some of the team across rides, security, and eats. I spoke to this guy on the marketplace team and another guy on the maps team, I was really interested in those teams.

What‚Äôs really cool about the marketplace team specifically is that it‚Äôs at the intersection of computer science, economics, optimization, statistics, and there‚Äôs a lot of hard & interesting problems that can be solved from an algorithmic perspective.

So after this event I attended, I knew that I wanted to be on the marketplace team at Uber. So during my senior year recruiting, I reached out to someone on the marketplace team, and they were interested in me, so that‚Äôs how I started interviewing at Uber.

**What is your team responsible for and why is this work critical to Uber‚Äôs business?**

I‚Äôm on the Shared Rides team (which is a part of Marketplace Dynamics). The core of building new shared rides products and features come from [matching improvements](https://marketplace.uber.com/matching) or UI and experience improvements. So either tweaking these algorithms, designing & analyzing experiments, understanding how users are responding to new product features - these are all very important and central to Uber‚Äôs business.

What are some challenges (both technical and non-technical) your team faces?

The biggest challenge for our team (and I think this is true for any consumer internet product) is building something that people actually like that meets your business objectives. Because everytime you change something with the product, one metric might become worse and the other might become better.

It‚Äôs also really hard to figure out what users really want and what they really like. This involves a lot of UX research, as well as experimentation. This stuff is really challenging. Here‚Äôs another example:

So, there‚Äôs an optimization & efficiency side of Shared Rides - there‚Äôs always a tension between the two. If I make something more optimal, it might hurt the experience. If I make the experience better, we have to give some leeway on the optimization side of things. So that‚Äôs this underlying technical tension that‚Äôs always there.

On the product side, as I had already mentioned, it just comes down to building something users really want. So we have designers and UX researchers who are embedded within shared rides, as well as marketing folks, and I have to work cross functionally with these guys to problem solve on a daily basis.

**You interned at Quora before Uber - can you tell me differences between both companies and how that affected your work?**

So Quora was a very small company - there were only 230 people or so when I was working there (two years ago). There were fewer layers of management, it was easier to know people across the company - for example I even got the chance to speak with the CEO on a couple of occasions. There was also less bureaucracy I guess.

At Uber, since it‚Äôs a bigger company, sometimes if you want to build something you might need to get buy-in from another team, there‚Äôs more bureaucracy, there‚Äôs more layers between you and executive management.

Like at Quora, I knew the Head of Data Science very well, but at Uber I can‚Äôt imagine doing that currently (given I‚Äôve just begun my career).

At a bigger company like Uber though, you‚Äôre working on projects that have bigger scope, bigger impact on the world, and you work with a lot more people. I‚Äôm also more specialized within my role here at Uber - at Quora I could have had more flexibility in terms of what I wanted to work on. At Uber, I‚Äôm on a very specific team, in a very specific role, working on a very specific part of the product. This has significant advantages: We‚Äôre working on specialized problems that are really challenging, and I‚Äôm surrounded by people who have been thinking deeply about these problems for a while are are super passionate about these problems. There‚Äôs some incredible learning to be had there.

Finally, in a smaller company it‚Äôs also a lot easier to hang out with your teammates - Quora for instance had organized clubs (poker, badminton etc) across the board that made it really easy to meet people in different teams. At Uber, that‚Äôs much harder to do, but you meet an equivalent amount of people within your own team, since teams are much larger at Uber.

**What advice would you give to someone looking to become a Data Scientist (either a career changer or a college student)?**

Data science roles are defined very differently based on the team, company, size, role you‚Äôre working on. For instance, even Uber Data Science can vary greatly across teams - for example, I work on the Shared Rides / Matching team, which is mostly Operations Research, which is a field about optimization. And I didn‚Äôt even study Operations Research in college. The important thing to understand is that different teams have different scopes. For instance, the pricing team does a lot of machine learning. Some other teams are trying to understand user experience. So having a strong base is really important, because at companies like Uber, there‚Äôs many directions you could go in.

In the Data Science industry overall, there‚Äôs broadly three tracks:

1. Algorithms (building models, doing ML)
2. Inference (understanding causality)
3. Analytics (building dashboards, writing SQL, reporting metrics, analyzing simple A/Bs)

Most of the Data Science jobs involve Analytics or Inference.

At Quora, they were mostly on the inference side of things. They were trying to understand product opportunities, trends in user behavior, and see if new product features were impactful.

On Uber, on my team at least, I‚Äôm more focused on building algorithms.

So in terms of advice: you need to focus on what you‚Äôre actually interested in (within the domains listed above). Of course, there‚Äôs going to be work that‚Äôs a mix of both, but knowing which topics interest you will help you map out and identify which companies you want to work for.

Everything is going to be very team and company specific, so don‚Äôt look at titles, but actually look at what the role is, talk to people on the team, and do your research.

Stats theory is also important, but on the job you‚Äôre not really going to be actively using theory too much. What really matters is understanding and gaining intuition. For example, I didn‚Äôt study a lot of Operations Research in college, but I took a bunch of Machine Learning and Algorithms classes in college which helped me build intuition for how Operations Research works, since the field is about optimization - which is what Machine Learning and Algorithms are about.

The purpose of theory is to build intuition and understand things.

Have had zero technical growth since then. Looking for a way out.

Myself: in my late 20s, started my career as a software engineer (2 YOE), then did a Masters in DS and since then have spent another 3 years as a data scientist (had one job in a mid-size startup and another one in a late-stage startup).

As a SWE, I wanted to switch to data science to have a more intellectually stimulating and rewarding job. Somehow I had this idea that DS would make it possible for me to pair my SWE skills with passion for maths, and I was really looking forward to lots of technical growth and exciting projects. Thinking now that this may have been my biggest career mistake so far as it's been the exact opposite.

Every single senior colleague I've been working with has been explicitly discouraging me from building anything more complex than a logistic regression, and usually suggested that I should implement some simple SQL / if-else solution instead. In fact, 90% of my job has always been data lackey work answering silly ad-hoc questions from stakeholders using SQL or basic pandas. I feel like I haven't learned anything in the last 3 years except for tons of non-transferrable domain knowledge that I deeply don't care about.

I totally get it that as a data scientist, I am expected to provide business value - and not build fancy models. It is just that I no longer see how I can pair being useful with having at least some benefits for my career and technical growth.

I once had this guy on my team who was complaining a lot about DS applicants he was interviewing back then. His problem was with them mentioning ""passion for neural networks"" on their CVs and not being ""down to earth"" enough. The guy then went on to change teams, work as a front-end developer and learn all the fancy React stuff, and then switched teams again to do backend engineering, learn yet another language and use his new skills to tackle some really cool problems.

Like wow, it almost feels as if people in this industry sincerely believe it is okay for a software engineer to keep learning and have lots of technical growth, whereas a data scientist is expected to know their place and be stuck doing SQL / occasionally treat themselves to some very basic ML.

I guess there are some DS positions out there that are not like that but they seem to be incredibly rare, and it feels like every year of this sort of ""experience"" makes it less and less likely for me to ever get into real ML as the market feels so competitive.

I am thinking that I should go back to software engineering while it's not too late. Have some of you guys been in a similar position? What do you think?",0

""Under no circumstances should someone claim credit for someone else's work. I was involved in litigation against Google for something similar over 10 years ago.

RSS feed readers ingest content and republish it with credit to the author. This step gives the author added exposure, like how radio stations offer musicians free advertising to sell their music.

Examples of news aggregators include Google News, Drudge Report, Huffington Post, Fark, Zero Hedge, Newslookup, Newsvine, World News (WN) Network and Daily Beast, where the aggregation is entirely automatic

I see that the automated algorithm was incorrectly listing the admin as the author on some of the articles, but there was no intent to deceive. If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of EACH ARTICLE, and that linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR. One more time: If you look, you will see that EVERY ITEM had the ""ORIGINAL SOURCE"" listed at the bottom of each piece that then linked to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR.

There was no intent to claim ownership. If so, it was a pretty hair-brained try, but I apologize to anyone who feels deserving.

Since I have no financial gain from this site, and no good deed goes unpunished, I decided to take it down. I don't need the aggravation to share useful content and authors if the reward is getting attacked.

I am an awarding winning researcher, as published in at least two national magazines. I don't need anybody else's credibility.

Many articles picked up by the RSS feeds I would be embarrassed to publish under my name.

I am confident that NOBODY, with a clue about data science, thought someone was writing hundreds of articles a week. Especially when posting the ORIGINAL SOURCE, and it links to the ORIGINAL AUTHOR at the bottom of each piece! Seriously!? SERIOUSLY!!!?

I've not made a penny from the site, nor have I ever tried (or wanted to). It was built as a news aggregator to promote the work of others and create a place to stay up to date without navigating to hundreds of sources (yes hundreds). That IS what news aggregators do! I received many thank you notes from authors happy to have extra exposure.

I apologize for my oversite in the way the aggregation algorithm posted. In hindsight, I wish the ""Original Source and Author"" link was on the top rather than the bottom (besides a few other items). I assure you my intent was genuinely excellent; I was trying to give those interested a convenient news aggregation a resource.

I don't create excuses, but please, it is sophomoric to jump from unintentional RSS feed read result to first-degree murder.

Trust me; if anybody worth their weight in Data Science thought you or anybody else got fooled by something so obvious, they would likely think you were in the wrong profession. I asked my 7th-grade daughter to read a few articles and then decipher who the source and author were, and she had NO PROBLEM correctly identifying them (hint, it was not me). I'm pretty sure you can relax.

What degree to pursue, PhD or not, Python vs. R, etc.

While different people will naturally have different opinions on the subject, I think it's particularly important to recognize that a person's path and past success will heavily bias their opinion.

Successful artists will tell up and coming ones to ""follow their dream"". But the reality is that a more personalized advice should probably be ""follow your dream if you're extremely talented, unique and have the family support to prevent you from ending up homeless"".

I think the same is true of this sub. Not everyone here has the inherent ability to become a Principal Scientist at Google, nor to become the Chief Data Officer for a Fortune 59 company. 
EDIT: I should have said ""not everyone has the right combination of inherent ability, work ethic, and/or life circumstances to become a (...). Inherent ability is one component, but the reality is that there are many reasons why a person may not get there - and not all of them are tied to ability.
Most importantly, not everyone's quality of life will be maximized by pursuing that life.

When you read advice on this sub, always keep a critical eye for how it applies to you, your inherent strengths and weaknesses, your current situation and your future opportunities.

Garth Brooks probably wouldn't take advice from Carrie Underwood. And if you are anything other that a generational talent of a guitar player, you should probably take any advice you get from Steve Vai with a gigantic grain of salt. 

If you're a world leading expert in computer vision, you don't need to take advice from people like me who have worked up the ladder in traditional functions. But if you're someone who doesn't have (and won't have the opportunity to get) a PhD in computer vision from a leading university in the world, then be very weary of taking advice from someone who does at face value - at least without being very aware of how to adapt it to your situation.",0

180,Passed TensorFlow Developer Certification,414,gc29zj,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gc29zj/passed_tensorflow_developer_certification/,94,"Hi,

I have passed this week the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) from Google. I could not find a lot of feedback here about people taking it so I am writing this post hoping it will help people who want to take it. 

The exam contains 5 problems to solve, part of the code is already written and you need to complete it.  It can last up to 5 hours, you need to upload your ID/Passport and take a picture using your webcam at the beginning, but no one is going to monitor what you do during those 5 hours. You do not need to book your exam beforehand, you can just pay and start right away. There is no restriction on what you can access to during the exam.

I strongly recommend you to take [Coursera's TensorFlow in Practice Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-in-practice) as the questions in the exam are similar to the exercises you can find in this course. I had previous experience with TensorFlow but anyone with a decent knowledge of Deep Learning and finishes the specialization should be capable of taking the exam.

I would say the big drawback of this exam is the fact you need to take it in Pycharm on your own laptop. I suggest you do the exercises from the Specialization using Pycharm if you haven't used it before (I didn't and lost time in the exam trying to get basic stuff working in Pycharm). I don't have GPU on my laptop and also lost time while waiting for training to be done (never more than \~10mins each time but it adds up), so if you can get GPU go for it! In my opinion it would have make more sense to do the exam in Google Colab... 

Last advice: for multiple questions the source comes from [TensorFlow Datasets](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets), spend some time understanding the structure of the objects you get as a result from load\_data , it was not clear for me (and not very well documented either!), that's time saved during the exam.

Laid off from a smaller company in the midwest due to COVID-19 cutbacks.

&#x200B;

1. **""Data scientist"" is turning into a blanket term. So is ""data analyst"".** So many of the jobs I've looked at truly want a data engineer/DBA but ask for a data scientist. Or want a data scientist but ask for an entry level data analyst. Expand your search terms, but read the job description to figure out what the company really wants. This changes every time I'm on the job market even in my short tenure as a data scientist. When did ""Machine Learning Engineer"" become so big??
2. **On that note: ""Senior"" vs ""Lead"" vs ""Entry Level""**...the difference to me is huge, but most companies seem to be pretty flexible with what they're posting. Some entry level jobs have been open to changing to senior level, some lead/manager level would be fine with senior. If you like a job but are weary about the experience required, just ask the hiring manager/recruiter that posted it.
3. **Every company has a different way of testing your knowledge.** So far I've taken a data science timed assessment (no outside resources), completed a take-home assessment (48 hours and a dataset), and presented a past project for 30 minutes, all for different companies. Be prepared for just about anything, but use how they test you as a clue into their culture. For me, I love the take-home tests and presentations because they give me a chance to show what I know without as much of the pressure.
4. **Companies are starting to open back up.** Many job postings were taken down from March-May, but as of today the number of openings is expanding rapidly. Region may be a big factor. The companies I have interviewed with have stuck to either all virtual, or majority virtual with one in-person interview with masks and social distancing.

After a month long process I GOT THE JOB!!! Found out about an hour ago, junior data scientist in the South florida area, 80k a year (100k with performance bonuses plus benefits). 


For anyone who wants advice or to familiarize themselves with how the process was:


Step 1) saw ad on linked in, sent my CV 


Step 2) Email with a take home project, they have us a 1 GB database and we had to make a predictive model for a churn rate after 2 years. Basically we had 5 linked dataframes one with customer information (2 million observations) and then 4 other data sets with 5-15 millions observations. Had to reduce it to one data frame. As in add a variable from the other data sets to the customer one based on customer ID i.e create stuff like age variable, account balance, number of services hired, credit score at the time they applied (trickiest one), and contract duration from the 4 other data sets.


Final DF was 1.5 million then had to filter by desired population, with all the filters the DF was only 35k observations and that's what I ran my models on.


It took about 6 hours but I googled A LOT of stuff #stackoverflow. I could've used mysql for the first part but they asked for the whole script in R or Python (I used R). I kept it simple did a Logit, a random forest and a SVM. Error rate with cross validation was about 15%, svm was the best model, baseline was 30%. Asked to make a ppt.




Step 3)  Phone interview asking about my degree and internship experience, 15 minutes told me at the end they want me to come to a face to face



Step 4) face to face interview, 30 minutes with the heads of the team I'd be in, asked why I like the industry, why this firm, where i see myself down the line, about potentially leaving, in depth questions about my undergrad degree and what I did in my internships. Afterwards they took a 15 questions multiple choice math test, (it was like the generic sat/gre math part). 



Step 5) interview with regional manager 30 minutes, more personal questions, talked a lot about the company and my role, what where my expectations, benefits, etc. At the end he took a 3 question test, one was what the angle of a triangle at 3:15 in a wall clock is, the second was why are manholes round, and another was how many cars do I think were sold in the U.S in 2019. 


Step 6) confirmation call!


My degree was a bs in economics with a specialization in econometrics and a minor in stats! Top 40 school ranked nationally. Hope this helps anyone applying!


.

Edit: Well apparently this is considered a very rigorous process and I agree, I have other friends who got similar jobs with easier processes. However it's my first job right out of college (december grad) and I only had 1 year experience. Also with bonuses I can expect to make about 100k so I think it's fair. Plus now you know if you can do steps 1-5 you're guaranteed to get a job even in the hardest of recruitment processes!",0
199,Well today was a depressing day for data science at work. What can I do better?,381,gsn5lz,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gsn5lz/well_today_was_a_depressing_day_for_data_science/,230,"I work as an Analytics Manager and normally I don't really share with my colleagues the in depth details of my work because nobody is technical. They just know I use SQL and Python to spit out a report and that's all they really understand.

Recently I had an opportunity to do something interesting where I had a very skewed data set and was asked to make sense of it. I thought applying a log transformation to normalize the data as the distribution was extremely skewed and thought it would make the data easier to interpret and I was happy with the results.

My colleagues wanted to know how I arrived at my conclusion for my recommendation so I walked them through the process. I provided a high level overview, but they really wanted to get into the nitty gritty of exactly HOW I got to where I got. Again, I normally don't like to do this because they tend ask very detailed questions like ""Can you explain exactly how this works so I can understand?"" and it gets tough to explain certain things (e.g., I would say something like ""I got this raw data from the API"" but then it's followed up by a question like ""What is an API and why didn't you just use the vendor's dashboard? Why doesn't the vendor's interface provide the data? Why do you have to go through this step?"").

Well anyway I was explaining my logic and really tip toed around the stats by really trying to say essentially that I applied some logic that would more even distribute the data. I stupidly said the word ""log"" and it was over. Their faces froze for a good 10 seconds before someone spoke.

""I'm sorry..but what? What is log? Why do you need this log? I'm really confused. How am I suppose to explain this to the SVP? Can you just change it so you're indexing off the median or mean? This doesn't make any sense.""

I'm dead.

So guys, how do you avoid getting away with having to explain things by  not using technical jargon? I mean like I said, I normally just show people the output of my report and I don't get too many in depth questions about it, but when people really pry, it gets tough. I don't know how to avoid saying ""I ran a regression model"" because it freaks people out and they get upset because they don't understand it and want me to do something that is easier to interpret. It's already frustrating that they think I'm over complicating things by using Python instead of Excel, but I can at least tell them certain things like Excel can't handle 1+ million rows and they can understand that.

EDIT: Hey all, appreciate all you feedback, both positive and negative. I think it's all constructive. There's a lot of replies in this thread so it's hard to answer everyone's questions. Some of you ask the same things and I do answer them, but you might have to dig through the comments to find it. In any case, let me post some frequently asked ones:

1) Did you use graphs and visuals?

Answer: I did. I actually stayed away from using the word log at first and just showed them a histogram of what the data looked like before the log transform and then after the log transform. What followed up was ""How did you do this? What did you use to index the numbers?"" And that's when I mentioned I used a log transformation.

2) How did you explain what a log transform was?

Answer: I didn't directly explain it in math terms. I described it in the form of an analogy or comparable example. This is what I said: 

""Imagine we were looking at salaries for a company. Most people for example will make a salary between something like $40 - 100k right? Well what if the top execs in the company make like $10 million dollars. Now imagine you tried to index using the mean? Wouldn't the mean say the average employee at this company makes a salary of $1 million dollars or something? That's not right. Basically, a log transformation would keep everyone's differences in consideration, but minimize the importance of some of those execs who are not entirely representative of the rest of the company. That way you can better see the difference in salary among every worker and not have your vision obscured by some of these execs who are throwing off that balance. ""

Unfortunately, this proved to be even more confusing and my colleagues really zoned in on exactly what a log was and how it's calculated and it was tough to navigate from there.

3) What is SVP?

Answer: It stands for Senior Vice President. It basically is a reference to our execs.",0

204,Excel is Gold,381,j6uqn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/j6uqn9/excel_is_gold/,151,"So i am working for a small/medium sized company with around 80 employees as Data Scientist / Analyst / Data Engineer / you name it. There is no real differentiation. I have my own vm where i run ETL jobs and created a bunch of apis and set up a small UI which nobody uses except me lol. My tasks vary from data cleaning for external applications to performance monitoring of business KPIs, project management, creation of dashboards, A/B testing and modelling, tracking and even scraping our own website. I am mainly using Python for my ETL processes, PowerBI for Dashboards, SQL for... data?! and EXCEL. Lots of Excel and i want to emphasise on why Excel is so awesome (at least in my role, which is not well defined as i pointed out). My usual workflow is: i start with a python script where i merge the needed data (usually a mix of SQL and some csv's and xlsx), add some basic cleaning and calculate some basic KPIs (e.g. some multivariate Regression, some distribution indicators, some aggregates) and then.... EXCEL

So what do i like so much about Excel?

First: Everybody understands it!   
This is key when you dont have a team who all speak python and SQL. Excel is just a great communication Tool. You can show your rough spreadsheet in a Team meeting (especially good in virtual meetings) and show the others your idea and the potential outcome. You can make quick calculations and visuals based on questions and suggestions live. Everybody will be on the same page without going through abstract equations or code. I made the experience that its usually the specific cases that matter. Its that one row in your sheet which you go through from beginning to end and people will get it when they see the numbers. This way you can quickly interact with the skillset of your team and get useful information about possible flaws or enhancements of your first approach of the model.

Second: Scrolling is king!  
I often encounter the problem of developing very specific KPIs/ Indicators on a very very dirty dataset. I usually have a soffisticated idea on how the metric can be modelled but usually the results are messy and i dont know why. And no: its not just outliers :D There are so many business related factors that can play a role that are very difficult to have in mind all the time. Like what kind of distribution channel was used for the sales, was the item advertised, were vouchers used, where there problems with the ledger, the warehouse, .... the list goes on. So to get hold of the mess i really like scrolling data. And almost all the time i find simething that inspires me on how to improve my model, either by adding filters or just understanding the problem a little bit better. And Excel is in my opinion just the best tool for the task. Its just so easy to quickly format and filter your data in order to identify possible issues. I love pivoting in excel, its just awesome easy. And scrolling through the data gives me the feeling of beeing close to the things happening in the business. Its like beeing on the street and talking to the people :D

Third (and last): Mockups and mapping

In order to simulate edge cases of your model without writing unit-tests for which you dont have time, i find it very useful to create small mockup tables where you can test your idea. This is especially usieful for the development of features for your model. I often found that the feature that i was trying to extract did not behave in the way i intended. Sure you can quickly generate some random table in python but often random is not what you want. you want to test specific cases and see if the feature makes sense in that case.  
Then you have mapping of values or classes or whatever. Since excel is just so comfortable it is just the best for this task. I often encountered that mapping rules are very fuzzy defined in the business. Sometimes a bunch of stakeholders is involved and everybody just needs to check for themselves to see if their needs are represented. After the process is finished that map can go to SQL and eventually updates are done. But in that eary stage Excel is just the way to go.

Of course Excel is at the same time very limited and it is crucial to know its limits. There is a close limit of rows and columns that can be processed without hassle on an average computer. Its not supposed to be part of an ETL process. Things can easily go wrong.   
But it is very often the best starting point.

I hope you like Excel as much as me (and hate it at the same time) and if not: consider!

I also would be glad to hear if people have made similar experiences or prefer other tools.",0

OK, cool, I've been a data science, I'm fallowing along with what they are talking about. And then they start to talk about putting jupyter notebooks *into production*. 

Wait...wut? They are putting these notebooks into production. The take these notebook they develop, and save them to shared drive, IT is writing wrappers that call these jupyter notebooks to run in production.

That scares the hell out of me. I've worked in notebooks and have lost track of how the notebook was executed, and which states ran when, and o dear, I fat figured a function I defined above somewhere and now I gotta figure out where it's breaking and o crap it's not running like it was before I restarted the kernel, and I realize I just deleted a cell.

Now imagine multiple people touching it. Even accidentally. I've seen folder go rouge on shared drives because of an accidentally click and drag.  Teammate make makes a small change, accidentally runs thing out of order so he adjust his change based on the new order he ran it in.

213,Every Kaggle Competition Submission is a carbon copy of each other -- is Kaggle even relevant for non-beginners?,362,gh3v0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gh3v0q/every_kaggle_competition_submission_is_a_carbon/,115,"When I was first learning Data Science a while back, I was mesmerized by Kaggle (the competition) as a polished platform for self-education. I was able to learn how to do complex visualizations, statistical correlations, and model tuning on a slew of different kinds of data.

But after working as a Data Scientist in industry for few years, I now find the platform to be shockingly basic, and every submission a carbon copy of one another. They all follow the same, unimaginative, and repetitive structure; first import the modules (and write a section on how you imported the modules), then do basic EDA (pd.scatter\_matrix...), next do even more basic statistical correlation (df.corr()...) and finally write few lines for training and tuning multiple algorithms. Copy and paste this format for every competition you enter, no matter the data or task at hand. It's basically what you do for every take homes.

The reason why this happens is because so much of the actual data science workflow is controlled and simplified. For instance, every target variable for a supervised learning competition is given to you. In real life scenarios, that's never the case. In fact, I find target variable creation to be extremely complex, since it's technically and conceptually difficult to define things like churn, upsell, conversion, new user, etc.

But is this just me? For experienced ML/DS practitioners in industry, do you find Kaggle remotely helpful? I wanted to get some inspiration for some ML project I wanted to do on customer retention for my company, and I was led completely dismayed by the lack of complexity and richness of thought in Kaggle submissions. The only thing I found helpful was doing some fancy visualization tricks through plotly. Is Kaggle just meant for beginners or am I using the platform wrong?",0

The documentary is more or less an attack on social media platforms (mostly Facebook) and how they've steadily been contributing to tearing apart society for the better part of the last decade. There's interviews with a number of former top executives from Facebook, Twitter, Google, Pinterest (to name a few) and they explain how sites have used algorithms and AI to increase users' engagement, screen time, and addiction (and therefore profits), while leading to unintended negative consequences (the rise of confirmation bias, fake news, cyber bullying, etc). There's a lot of great information presented, none of which is that surprising for data scientists or those who have done even a little bit of research on social media.

In a way, it painted the practice of data science in a negative light, or at least how social media is unregulated (which I do agree it should be).

242,"Why arguing about who is a ""Real Data Scientist"" is a misguided exercise",343,bezjso,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bezjso/why_arguing_about_who_is_a_real_data_scientist_is/,75,"One of the most common arguments these days revolves around what constitutes a ""real"" Data Scientist, and by proxy, who is deserving of the Data Scientist title. A popular opinion is that Data Scientists need to do machine learning or they're not real data scientists.

I think this completely misses the point of job titles: job titles are not meant to define a role. Job titles are meant to be corporate abbreviations for job descriptions. It is job descriptions that are matched against outside salary references, and it is job descriptions that are graded for pay purposes. Job descriptions are used for hiring purposes and ultimately job descriptions describe the job that you do.

There are some professions where titles have very real meanings (Lawyers who pass the bar exam, Professional Engineers who pass the P.E. exam, Accountants who are certified CPAs, etc.), but the majority of titles don't mean anything, and Data Scientist is certainly in that camp.

Other examples:

- At a lot of large corporation, you see Sr. Managers that don't manage anyone (i.e., have no direct reports).

- Every person in national/executive sales is a VP, even though they are not responsible for a P&L and often don't even have direct reports. Oh, and they make less money than a Director in every other branch of the company.

- Every bank title is incredibly inflated (again, TONS of VPs)

- Every quant/trading title is incredibly deflated - they'll seemingly call someone an analyst their whole lives even if they're making 400k and have 15 years experience.

The only constraints on job titles are often internal, and a consequence of how they fit relative to existing internal job descriptions. Specifically, if a specific job title term (e.g., Engineer, Analyst, Consultant) has traditionally been associated with a certain set of skills and responsibilities, a new role that has completely new requirements should in general avoid using the same title.

So why are so many companies giving Data Science titles to people who don't do Machine Learning given that the original data scientists had to? Here is what the life-cycle of creating a role looks like *at a company that doesn't have existing data science capabilities*:

1) Hiring manager decides she needs a new person with a profile that doesn't exist in the form of an existing job description. She needs this person to do mostly analysis, but she also needs them to be able to write code in Python to automate some processes, build the occasional model (likely not a production model), and access back-end databases directly and often. She may also, in time, need this person to dedicate more time to building more advanced statistical models, maybe even ML models, but as of right now that is highly uncertain because the company has never used ML in the past.

2) After writing this job description, the key hitting points look something like this: 

* Must have 2+ years experience with R/Python
* Must have 2+ years experience with SQL
* Must have experience building statistical models.
* A whole bunch of business and soft skills stuff

3) HR receives this job description and they now need to grade it. Since they have Analyst/Sr Analyst roles already, they compare the job description against those roles. They quickly find that none of those job descriptions require R/Python, SQL or building models. But they do match a lot of the other requirements, so it becomes clear that they will need a different type of role that is both different (includes Python/SQL/Modeling) and higher (more requirements) than the existing Analyst/Sr. Analyst roles. They may have even higher levels of Analyst (Lead, Principal), but none of them will require the use of Python/SQL/Modeling, so the fact of the matter is that they are going to need to get away from the Analyst title or otherwise create confusion and internal inconsistencies.

4) In order to do their benchmarking, HR pulls salaries and comp from an external data source that helps them match job description requirements to those posted by other companies. They work their way through putting the job description requirements into the system, and the system tells HR what jobs with similar JDs pay, including a range. It also tells this person the titles of the people who have similar JDs - which will likely include jobs that are legitimate Data Science jobs as they require R, Python, SQL, and statistical modeling experience. But it also will include some Analyst roles that do require programming skills (maybe some quant roles), and other random role titles that no one would think of looking into. All in all, the job grade that comes back is higher than an Analyst role (because of the added skills), but not quite as high as that of the first-gen Data Scientists, i.e., Ph.D. + 5 years experience in Silicon Valley. 

5) Now they need a job title. They know they can't name the role ""Analyst"" or ""Sr. Analyst"" because the skill set (and job grading) is different. Therefore they want to avoid having one ""Analyst"" making considerably more money than the rest of the Analysts, and also would like to make it clear that current Analysts may not have the skillset needed for this new role. They may, but it cannot be assumed by default that they do. They currently don't have any data scientists, so there's no toes to step on there, so it becomes a natural solution to name this new role ""Data Scientist"". Why that and not a completely new title to avoid clashing with the existing Data Scientist roles that are more senior in the marketplace?

* **You want a title that can be easily found by people with the right skillset**: because the candidate you are looking for has some characteristics of an old school data scientist and some of an analyst, you want to hit with a title that will catch the high-end of the pool you're looking for. ""Analyst"" may leave some of those people out. 

* **You want the role to be easy to find**: you can title the job ""Programming Friendly Analyst"", but it would just make it harder to get it to show up on searches. Meanwhile, because people are searching for the Data Scientist role often, it gives you better visibility. 

And there you have it, you now have a Data Scientist opening that you can post. Odds are you will get a wide range of candidates applying, including some who will be greatly overqualified (but will inquire because of the Data Science title being so variable), but you will end up hiring someone who is, ideally, at the top end of your requirements.

More importantly, as more and more companies do this, the general convergence is not based on original data science roles, but rather the new data science roles that are going to be more common because they will fill a need in a much larger market (i.e., more companies need people to tame their data and run basic modeling, fewer companies are ready for cutting edge ML).

You will certainly have organizations where step 5 is different, i.e., where the ""Analyst"" roles already have programming requirements (quants, consulting are all great examples), and in that case it makes sense that Data Scientist will be defined as ""can do ML"", because the only reason to create a new role will be to differentiate people who can do analysis, modeling, and programming from those who can do all of those things AND build machine learning models.

And then you have the even more extreme examples, FANGs, where you are seeing the creation of roles that are even more technical than Data Scientist (like Applied Scientist and Research Scientist and ML Engineer), which - again - were likely required to create internal differentiation between people who can execute machine learning models vs. people who can develop brand new machine learning concepts/scale machine learning to solve massively complex applications/etc.

On to my last point: to those who are on the cutting edge of machine learning and AI knowledge who feel ""icky"" getting lumped in with us simpletons who are just running fancy regression models to make our companies more money - just know that the reason your salaries are continuing to increase is because the number of companies hiring Data people like myself to solve simpleton problems is blowing up the market, and creating a scarcity everywhere in the field that is driving salaries up. So, while I understand that you like the prestige of having a title that reflects just how much more about machine learning you know that the rest of us, please appreciate that the popularity of the general field of Decision Science has greatly benefited you directly.

**TL;DR: No one company/group of people get to dictate what is/isn't a ""Data Scientist"". It is a natural response of the market to allow those companies looking for employees to find the right job seekers while satisfying internal corporate constraints. To continue to argue about who is/isn't a data scientist is pointless, because the title itself actually doesn't mean anything. Most importantly, a rising tide lifts all boats, and we have all benefited from the demand for all types of data scientists.**",1

But school gave me an overview of several topics. 

Data structures and algorithms class taught me the sorting algorithms, recursion, evolved recursion(dynamic programming), and the space-time trade off for various data structures...but I only had a few assignments to internalize the several concepts I was taught. 

Preparing for interviews and learning how to code these concepts taught me so much more. For one, I had to implement all of these from scratch and I practiced them much more than once or twice(unlike in school). I was also exposed to many more algorithms thanks to geeksforgeeks and the interview questions I had. 

My initial data science class taught me how to query from api‚Äôs, create visualizations, some linear/logistic regression and use Hadoop for a bigram word counts. 

But studying for interviews taught me these same concepts in much more depth and gave me much more muscle memory. 

Same with sql- my school never had a proper class on sql- we had one group project for a client where we dabbled in sql a little

It was only after practicing sqlzoo and hackerrank that I actually even truly understood sql. 

I look back and ask why. It‚Äôs simple- I learn better when answering quiz like questions on several topics over and over again and writing code for the same algorithms several times. School doesn‚Äôt give you that opportunity to fail your way to understanding the material.

249,Perception vs. reality -- how to break into data science,328,fb7f7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fb7f7o/perception_vs_reality_how_to_break_into_data/,133,"I interview candidates for data roles at my company. I'm a data scientist in Australia. \[**Edit:** Thanks for the questions so far ‚Äì ask me anything ‚Äì happy to respond!\]

I feel there's a discrepancy between (1) what people ***think*** makes them good candidates for data science / engineering roles vs. (2) what ***actually*** makes them good candidates for data science / engineering roles.

1. **What some people** ***think*** **makes them good candidates for data roles at a company:** master's degree in data science; Kaggle projects; worked through a reading list; taken online courses in data science.
2. **What** ***actually*** **makes people good candidates for data roles at a company:** collected and analysed data for fun; worked with data at a company before; worked with data in a research role in a university.

How do these differ, in practice? The second group of people know that data is messy; they're motivated to work with data; they've used real-world tools; they seem more ""interesting""; they have hard-won critical thinking and communication skills.  All of these things are important in data science.

Implications: If you want to break into the area of data science, and you don't have much experience, work on a real project that requires you to collect, analyse, and present real data. E.g. work as a research assistant; email professors to ask if there are research projects you can get involved with; contact people in small- to medium-sized companies asking if you can help them with real data problems they have. ***Get as much real-world experience as you can, as early as you can.***",0

Supervisor explains a very vague problem and the dataset badly

Realize they have no idea how to implement this at all

Question how they are the senior manager of data if they don't know how to code worth shit

Suggest to supervisor ways to solve said goal

Supervisor starts to explain how I'm wrong before I even finish my sentence

Write down what I think they want me to solve

Study topic and solutions

Ask other supervisor question about problem since supervisor 1 is nowhere to be found

Supervisor 2 explains it completely different than supervisor 1 to the point that you doubt your sanity 

Continue to work on said problem

Find a good few sources and come up with a solution

Supervisor 1 finds you 1 hour before the end of your shift

Explain what you found and did, but before you finish, proceeds to explain how they want it to be done (usually in excel)

Realize their idea of a solution is borderline retarded

Edit2: It seems to me that everyone is interpreting  that because I'm complaining I'm also not a good, diligent worker. It's possible to realize that you're lucky and realize this is a great opportunity but also see how the environment can be less than ideal. The point of the post was to be more humorous than anything. I work very hard every day and stay late four out of five days a week. When I'm at home I watch videos and read about data science. Just because someone shares an experience that is negative doesn't mean that they don't appreciate or work hard at their job. In fact, both of my supervisors have praised my work in the short time I've been there. You shouldn't be so quick to judge, but again, this is the internet so I'm not sure what I expected. As for the coming in late part, that was just flair. Our company is New School so they let employees come in between 7 and 9 and leave early if they get their work done.",0

259,How is Python easier than R?,324,in710s,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/in710s/how_is_python_easier_than_r/,310,"I come from a more statistical background but I was in BME before that and I just can‚Äôt see it. 

Yea I understand Python has scikit and Tensorflow/Keras. Scikit is easier than for example caret in R. And Keras makes DL easy too. 

However, for any general data analysis and manipulation Python feels way harder. Before even doing a linear regression I have to know wtf a ‚Äúclass‚Äù object is and how it works. I don‚Äôt think in terms of classes and OOP at all. I think more mathematically. (I did get used to this part of Python now but it took longer and I am still not good with making my own class) 

Compare that to R where literally on day 1 of using it I can figure out how to use lm() and glm(). I don‚Äôt need to know any OOP. 

Then pandas is another hellhole. The whole .loc and .iloc differences and indexing becomes annoying. Can‚Äôt figure out how to nest the dataframe easily by a group so that I can resample within a group for every group type thing and when I look it up I get a bunch of solutions pointing to using dictionary and iterators etc. In R I could use group_by() with nest() and then use map() or lapply(). 

Oh also and then if you do a=b in python it doesn‚Äôt create a copy but its some pointer. In R I can do this without worry with no idea what a pointer even is. While Python there is some no.copy() or copy.deepcopy() you have to use. 

Without CS knowledge R is FAR FAR easier. I can literally get right into the analysis without learning all this overhead about data structures and class objects. Data manipulation is so easy with dplyr and purrr and the % &gt; %

Then to get interactions and everything within a design matrix in Python I have to use patsy so that I can do the R-like formula syntax. 

Maybe for unstructured data like images/NLP and deep learning Python might be better but all the data I deal with is tabular. For unstructured data you need some CS knowledge anyways.

260,How do I get out of data science?,321,g8250o,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/g8250o/how_do_i_get_out_of_data_science/,125,"Edit: Thanks for all the help and good ideas. I think I really just need more variety and (substantial) human interaction in my work. A couple mentioned they didn't have trouble going into systems engineers from data science, so I'll look into that. I work for a defense contractor that really focuses on IT implementations, and I think I want to get more into working with tangible products. So I don't know if I can quite do what I want without making a lateral move. I live right down the road from Raytheon and the ULA, so after all this blows over, I think I'll send my resume out. I'll also talk to my boss and see if I can shadow our company's product managers for a little while. I don't know a ton about that world but it does seem interesting. Thanks a ton! 

I've worked as a data scientist for a couple years now, and I'm really unhappy. I've worked at a start up and a large company. I'm well compensated but I've really grown to hate my career.

I'm tired of spending my days staring a computer. I'm tired of working for ""AI experts"" who couldn't import a Python module if their lives depended it. I'm tired of having to solve everyone's data problems and having my projects drag out for months. 

I've considered systems engineering and project management, but I don't feel like I have enough experience for that. 

What else can I do? I don't really want to go back to school because I hated college and honestly didn't do very well. Has anyone else made a transition out of data science?",0

Over the past 6 months I've been working on a technical book focused on helping aspiring data scientists to get hands-on experience with cloud computing environments using the Python ecosystem. The book is targeted at readers already familiar with libraries such as Pandas and scikit-learn that are looking to build out a portfolio of applied projects.

To author the book, I used the Leanpub platform to provide drafts of the text as I completed each chapter. To typeset the book, I used the R bookdown package by Yihui Xie to translate my markdown into a PDF format. I also used Google docs to edit drafts and check for typos. One of the reasons that I wanted to self publish the book was to explore the different marketing platforms available for promoting texts and to get hands on with some of the user acquisition tools that are commonly used in the mobile gaming industry. 

Here's links to the book, with sample chapters and code listings:

263,Some advice for young and aspiring Data Scientists,318,6q1y7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6q1y7b/some_advice_for_young_and_aspiring_data_scientists/,77,"I've decided to make this small post to help people navigate this big world of data science, feel free to ask any follow up questions, and please do not PM me, any questions you have, ask them here, for everyone to see.

My background: I did a Phd and Masters in Data Science/ML, ML summer school, ML researcher at UCLA and Data Scientist at NASA. Currently do Data Science as a consulting gig, with a company.

**Architectures**

- Learn how to use Hadoop/Spark. But for the love of God, don't spend 3 months configuring your own Hadoop cluster. Is fun (I've done it), but is just not worth it. Familiarize yourself with plug and play systems like ElasticMapReduce (Amazon), HDInsight (Microsoft Azure), Cloudera or Hortonworks. They have all the tools you might need afterwards (NIFI, Storm, etc). 

- Learn how to setup and administer at least one SQL database and a non-SQL type. In a good company you will have a data engineer that will do that for you, but is always nice to know what the hell is happening.

- Don't try to understand and be fluent in every single tool available, learn the tools when you need to use them. I can't tell you how much time I've lost learning tools that I never used.

**Languages**

- DS is not art, you do not need beautiful languages like Haskell or be fluent in Design Patterns. DS is ugly hacking most of the time.

- As a followup learn Python or R, both are languages where hacking is rather easy and straightforward and have plenty of ways to interact with popular Big Data paradigms.

**Background**

- Learn math, really, you won't become a Data Scientist just because you know SQL and a bit of Python. Many times, the problem needs a not so obvious tool, and just using a demo algorithm from sklearn won't solve the problem.

- Before using an algorithm, be sure which function it is optimizing. You wouldn't use linear regression for classification, right? Why? Because both have different objective functions, and are optimizing different stuff.

- Really, really, don't just plug and play algorithms. We are not there yet.

- Start with simple models, and if they don't work move to more complex things. Data Science is not research, we are not competing to have the best accuracy, many times, the client doesn't give a shit about accuracy, just that their problem is solved. Honestly, unless you are Google or Facebook, your problems can be probably solved without using DeepLearning.

- On that note, don't jump steps. Don't start trying to do DeepLearning if you don't know other algorithms like SVMs or Logistic Regression. You would be amazed how many clients tell me they want to use Deep Learning and have like 500Kb of data.",0

I don't have the answers to these questions, because I haven't had to deal with them yet, but I can see that they are on the horizon for me:

-How to work with cloud computing/ aws instances:
For example, if I needed to work with lots of data that I can't handle on my local machine, how do I set up a cloud instance to get this going, and is the experience the same as working on a local machine?

-How to get machine learning models built in Python into a production ready product:
For instance, the most common way I see folks doing this is by using the flask library with docker. I've actually never had to do this yet, but it's something on the horizon and there are very few step by step guides out there.

-How to set up a BI environment:
Bored analysts are often relegated to managing the data in some sort of BI platform. What are the best practices here, and what tools are you using? What's the easiest BI platform to use with Python so that I can limit the amount of scripting and transformations done in the BI tool.

-Best practices for documenting data lineage:
For example, when working with a BI platform such as Qlik, Tableu, etc, what are the best practices for documenting data transformations conducted in these tools for any kind of root error tracking in analysis? 

-Best practices for building a proof-of-concept:
For example, if I want to build some sort of deep learning algorithm that can do some crazy shit, what's the best way to build a proof of concept to get buy in from the rest of the team?

I think it would be cool if we could start generating a list of questions, or topics, there aren't given the attention they deserve on common learning platforms such as data camp, dataquest, udemy, Coursera, etc, which all seem to focus primarily on building models and underlying math concepts, but don't really answer some of the challenges you face in a business setting.",0

One of my teammates took a SQL query that another department wrote and sped it up by an order of magnitude (45 minutes to about 4 minutes) by pulling data into four different temporary tables and joining on those. That's the sort of insight I'm looking to build.

Any recommendations on tutorials? I'm looking for some intermediate SQL resources, preferably geared toward teaching you *when* you'd want to use certain techniques.

276,Rejected by 4 companies at final interview stage because I don't have enough business experience. Potential freelance project fell through. Losing hope.,311,j38aqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/j38aqo/rejected_by_4_companies_at_final_interview_stage/,80,"Note: I'm based in Europe.

I transitioned to industry after completing my PhD in psychology and education two years ago. My first job was as a data science instructor at a company that makes data-related online courses for big corporate clients. After 10 months, I got hired as the first data scientist at very small company that, in hindsight, was not at all ready for data science (barely even data analytics). Needless to say, my industry experience is limited--what little experience I have barely counts.

When I got laid off in June, I actually didn't have a hard time getting interviews. I organize events for women in tech groups in my city, so the friends I've made through that have gone out of their way to refer me for unlisted jobs.

To date I've been turned down by 4 companies at the final stage. The feedback is almost all the same: great attitude, would fit well in the team, excellent communication skills esp for non-tech stakeholders--but no direct business experience. I was supposed to work on a predictive analytics project as a subcontractor, but the firm told me today that the client wanted someone with--again--more business experience.

I know I'm not your typical STEM data scientist, but based on the feedback I got, I'm pretty sure I did my part articulating my transferable skills at interviews. But when it comes down to it, they still don't take me because I don't have the \*exact\* experiences they're looking for. For example, I've done a lot of experiments in my academic career, but since I've never done A/B testing before I was turned down for a job. What hurts most is that my contacts have told me that the hiring teams didn't exactly have other strong candidates.

What do I do? The folks in my network tell me that I'm a brilliant candidate and a great person to work with, but I feel like none of that matters.",0
277,About IBMs Data Science Certification,315,eleuz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/eleuz9/about_ibms_data_science_certification/,65,"Yesterday, there was a top post on this sub on 30day trial IBM gives for its [data science courses, specializations and certs](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science). I looked at it, saw 4.6 and 4.7 star averages and courses with interesting titles and syllabus so I decided to take it and try to power finish it, since I already have some experience.

So I finished first two courses and boy oh boy - what a disaster. It is well expected for this kind of cert to force you use ecosystem of the provider being that google, amazon, IBM or whoever. However, you would expect it to be a WORKING environment. Everything is so outdated in the course notes, software looks nothing like in instructions, some of it even got completely revamped. There are issues with account creation, 503 server response everywhere, loading times in scale of minutes and so on.

At first I thought it was me, my system or location issues, but then you open forums and see hundreds or thousands of complaints that reach back to beginning of 2019 or end of 2018 even. There are band-aid fixes that are sometimes provided, but something that worked 8 months ago doesn't work now since something changed again. All in all a terrible experience.

All of this is just technical problems that made me tell others about this. What I will leave here without much in-depth analysis is the actual quizes and assignments, which I would call at least questionable in the sense how much someone can learn from. Sometimes it feels like it is testing your ability to use IBMs way of doing things, not the actual underlying technology.

Although I saw all this in their second course, I investigated other courses in specialization since i thought this was kind of a non essential topic (using notebooks and other resources). They all follow similar pattern with lot of people feeling disappointed and wanting their money back. From that I decided to bail from it, and felt the need to share this. All of this is easily verifiable by going to said courses, and selecting reviews - then most helpful. Who knows how these courses got such high grade average. Maybe they were good enough at the time they were made. This would be a terrible way for someone to enter data science world.",0

No matter how much I try to check and double check what I have, I always seem to miss something and make some errors. 

I am more better at building something than checking numbers. For example, I can build dashboards, queries, troubleshoot, even ETL loads, then analyzing data and looking at the numbers from an analytical perspective. Not sure if I explained myself well here.

I work as a cook at a seafood restaurant and feel like this gives me a unique opportunity to collect some data on how much food we cook/waste a day. I would like to complete a project that predicts how much food we will sell at certain times on different days of the week, is this doable? The restaurant throws out a lot of each night, and I feel like completing a project like this could help solve this problem by predicting how much food needs to be cooked within the last hour of being open and it would also look great on a resume. Do you all have any tips on data collection or models to use? Thanks!",0

I have an undergrad in information systems. I went through college math classes like calculus, multi-variable calculus, statistics, discrete mathematics and linear algebra.

As soon as I entered the master's program in computer science, I always felt that I was missing some math in comparison to people who have had a computer science undergrad. That thought haunted me. Because of that thought, I was reviewing math during my master's and took hard math courses other computer science students didn't want to enroll in because they heard they were hard. I passed those classes, even though sometimes it was brutally hard to balance that class alongside my difference exams (which I had since I came from information systems undergrad). In short, my past 2 years of computer science master's were brutally hard, but I had the chip on my shoulder from coming from an information systems undergrad and worked extra hard to pass classes (and sometimes more than just pass).

**In the past few weeks, I had this idea that I should review math from the ground-up (start off with all the Khan Academy videos, then move towards textbooks) because I most likely have gaps in my math knowledge.** Even though I know that most computer science master's degree holders have some gaps in their math knowledge (as does anyone), this thought won't leave me. I still have that chip on my shoulder coming from an information systems undergrad and this, I think, is my impostor syndrome.

**I want to be a data scientist or a machine learning engineer - but the positions I'm after are not some research positions where I'd be developing a new algorithm.** The positions I'm after are simpler - applying BERT to new languages, for example. After I get the hang of the job, I thought of doing freelance consulting work. If during my job I encounter some material I need to brush up on (whether it's math or something else) I can review it on the fly. Even if I have to read some paper on my job, usually the formulas there are already derived and if I don't understand them, I can ask someone on my job or I can ask people on this subreddit or something similar. And let's also not forget that while I may not remember how to find derivatives of complicated functions by hand, I did have all that math through my academic education.

**What do you think, data scientists of reddit? Does it make sense for someone in my position to review math from the ground-up, or is it the impostor syndrome speaking?** I am the kind of person that is always erring on the side of discipline and hard work, so this may now be backfiring, but maybe I should execute my plan of reviewing the math or maybe I should just relax.",0

It's always been mathematical and statistical, and in my second bout of education, focused more on computing to apply this math.

But for data scientists we have to know so much spanning different fields. **From math, statistics, to optimization, to data structures, and algorithms, to your specific programming language gotchas, more advanced statistical + computing algorithms including ML/DL/ etc...**

How can someone possibly remember all of this and retain all the different sources of knowledge in memory? It's not like I have not been taught this and didn't know the specifics before. But it's never efficiently stored in memory. For some very common basics, I have to look up and remember how they work again.

1. So take linear regression for example something I've studied multiple times before. It's the most basic. I can right now tell you the general formula of the equation, and what it's trying to do. But if someone were to ask me right now to explain the internals of gradient descent (DESPITE taking multiple courses that taught/used this concept), I wouldn't be able to tell you. I can tell you the gist, and I have some visualization of my mind of the process, in that it's essentially trying to look for the direction of highest negative change.  For logistic regression, I can tell you its for classification and that it uses MLE to solve, but would have to look up again the implementation. For example, I don't remember how MLE works but know its related to probability.
2. If someone were to then ask me to explain something that involves more computing and computer science. So say something about bytes, binary representation, how it's used. I can give you the general gist that it's used to represent/store data in an efficient manner. But that's it. I can't give you more specifics to that, and would probably have to learn it all again with more details.
3. With data structures/algorithms, despite learning it before, I can give you a general gist of what they involve, but that's it. For example, a dictionary is cool because it allows easy key lookup because it uses hash representation. A list is ordered and is iterable, etc... I understand the general concept of time complexity but probably will struggle if asked to figure out whether something represents exponential time. Just the other day, had to refresh on the differences between hashable and mutable, etc...

My point is, there's just so many different fields we have to have working knowledge on. And don't even get me started with more http, web servers, etc...  It's something I haven't been taught and haven't had the chance to learn yet as I'm still trying to remember, learn, maintain everything else. How do people REMEMBER all of this? I had to look up the basics of hypothesis testing the other day, as I remembered its gist, but not how to implement it. Is this normal?",0

* Also have security related certifications (Security+)
* I mentor both the cybersecurity and AI clubs for my high school (along with a few other alumni)

I was contacted on LinkedIn by a recruiter. I have never really had an intention of working at FAANG organizations. From what I have read both on Reddit and elsewhere, the ""work 7 days a week"" and high pressure culture doesn't fit what I am really looking for. However, the recruiter mentioned almost 60% more than I make now, so that was enticing.

I feel technically sound -- but I definitely don't know how succinctly I could give an answer to some technical questions. I've looked at:

 [https://towardsdatascience.com/the-amazon-data-scientist-interview-93ba7195e4c9](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-amazon-data-scientist-interview-93ba7195e4c9)

Are these good resources? Should I be prepared to write an algorithm from scratch? Would it be easier things, like kmeans, or am I expected to code backprop from scratch? I've done these things from scratch before, but I used reference material... I am nervous about not being able to demonstrate my skills because of being too focused on providing these overly technical answers.

Any advice is appreciated!

309,Data Scientists are just glorified analysts (and why Research Scientist is the new Data Scientist),284,fpcltw,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fpcltw/data_scientists_are_just_glorified_analysts_and/,167,"Data Scientist here in a mid-sized company in Bay Area tech. After working in this industry for few years, the fact that Data Scientist in no longer a true Data Scientist position is the only natural conclusion I can come up with. There are obviously those in companies, reputable or not, who get to do and productionize complex modeling solutions (especially if you have a PhD), but the overall trend is that most ""Data Scientists"" without PhDs in big companies have become SQL monkeys who don't even get to do something as simple as A/B testing. This is like if front-end web developers were rebranded as software engineers.

I mean it's even public knowledge too:  Lyft publicly stated how they rebranded the titles from analyst to scientist and data scientist to research scientist. This was  just to compete with other tech companies for talent that want the ""scientist"" in their title. [https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c](https://medium.com/@chamandy/whats-in-a-name-ce42f419d16c). I was told by a buddy in FANG that Facebook is the one that started this trend.

How did this happen and what's the consequence? I don't know the precise origin, but I know that today what's driving this movement is the huge rush new grads with ""data science"" degrees, or perhaps waves of career changers from bootcamps who also want to find their gold.

What's the consequence? I think the consequence is that we all suffer from the rebranding, especially in terms of career development. First of all, it cheapens the name for everyone who holds this title. Second, those who have been doing true Data Science work (not just SQL all day for metrics tracking) will have to shift expectations and titles in order to preserve what they already have. Third, being stuck on menial tasks that don't impact business bottom line will make the job more expendable, meaningly highly susceptible to layoffs far more than those that are in the front lines of business/product impact. Fourth, this means lack of promotion and career development, since those who do get those have proven impact on business.

Yes, I have become jaded and pessimistic about the Data Science world in the Bay, especially not having a PhD myself that limits me from pursuing Research Scientists positions...

**EDIT:** It's quite funny that half of agree with me and half of you disagree vehemently. I actually want to be proven wrong in this case. But I'm nonetheless surprised that people couldn't care less about the HR who are cheapening the name of a scientist to make their job search easier and directing all their criticism toward a fellow Data Scientist just for pointing this situation out.

Also, yes, titles might not matter for you individually, but not having a clear breakdown of the work expectations in an organizational and institutional level is not a sign of progress. You wouldn't make this claim on the murky division is labor on government or hospital jobs for instance, or any positions of authority in public/private space.

Finally, Science as a title infers hypothesis, testing, validation through formulaic rules (mathematic or otherwise), etc. Yea sure at the end of the day, titles are just semantics, but the other extreme end of that is saying that ""well what's the problem of giving a someone who munges chemistry data the title of a ""Chemical Scientist""? Hell let's call anyone who deals with legal data a Lawyer. What this shows it that titles do matter to some degree, because it infers authority over a particular subject and the technical know-how. To throw this concept to the garbage can so that HR can have better leads on candidates feels a bit insulting.",0
310,I kind of hate my job as a data scientist. Do you like your jobs? Any advice for me?,282,9krcbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9krcbd/i_kind_of_hate_my_job_as_a_data_scientist_do_you/,161,"So, I supposedly work for the ""best place to work"" in my city due to a positive culture, pay, work/life balance, etc etc. But, the culture around data science is not very fun, maybe even toxic. The company dates back to the late 1800s-early 1900s and the average tenure is over 15 years so, it is so slow to change and largely run by, what I call, ""intestinal analytics."" I can't really afford to leave right now because I made the mistake of living at my means and I have plenty of debt to pay down before I can move, maybe a year and a half longer before I can afford a pay cut without dramatically decreasing my standard of living, which takes a bit of time to liquidate assets anyhow.

&#x200B;

They hired our entire team over the course of one year. We are a team of 12 and I am one of 6 Data Scientists. I was initially hired due to my abilities in R. I did some of the advanced modeling work for a while, which I enjoyed. After a few months, the higher ups decided to purchase tableau. I was the only one of the team with prior tableau experience so, I got moved over to tableau world. At first, that was fine because I had to refresh my memory and relearn a lot of things as well as train another team member. Now, it's tedious and boring. So, now, it's me and a coworker who live in tableau world. The bad part is less the boringness and more so the fact that we are responsible for facing the company and building something presentable out of the modeling work that others can understand.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, the models show that the company is losing ground in comparison to competitors, which, for some reason, we get yelled at over, because ""the modeling can't be correct."" It is. They just don't like it. Keep in mind, the profit margin for this company is over 60% so, it's a bunch a spoiled old people who throw temper tantrums when they hear things they don't like. Another thing is that when we do roll out a very useful tool or valuable information, that's appreciated for about 15 seconds, then we get bombarded with requests to change colors to different colors based upon the person and no one is happy because they don't have their own individual view.

&#x200B;

The culture attitude towards my one coworker and I has also been on a steady decline since the company decided on a ""salary transparency policy"" about a month ago. During a reorg, I got a 25k increase, that I thought everyone else got. Apparently that isn't the case. Only my cowroker who also works primarily with Tableau did as well. Once that got out, she and I have faced a steady stream of judgement because we are making more money to do what is seen as easier. HR issued a statement saying that we got the increase due to the business facing nature and value tableau reports are adding to the company. Either way, it has been uncomfortable, especially when we need their help on something and since we are the youngest on the team.

&#x200B;

My coworker who works with me on tableau lives the next street over so we carpool a lot and she spends most of her commute home crying about how much she hates her job. I don't cry, but sometimes I really want to. We are both at the point where the money just isn't worth being totally miserable to 40 hours a week.

313,Fired from my first real data science job at 6 weeks.,282,ayapts,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ayapts/fired_from_my_first_real_data_science_job_at_6/,152,"I have been an analyst for several years, and recently moved into data science. Some of my roles have not always been terribly technical, because the employer was unwilling to provide tools. I have made do and practiced data science at home on my own time to improve or gain skills. 

I left my last job for what I thought was a long term data scientist role (government clearance!). It took 3 weeks to gain access to the data and once I finally did, it was incredibly messy and unstructured. I was told there will be significant and ample time for ramp up. I literally began building an NLP model yesterday and was looking to deploy it soon. 

I got the call from the staffing agency to not return to the facility due to lack of performance. They felt I made zero progress even though I was fleshing out issues and creating data science documentation for the team. Even when I asked, there were no clear details of what the organization was looking for. I had a path forward and expressed what I was working on to add value. If they wanted/needed something else, no one said a word. 

At 6 weeks, fired. Back to the drawing board again. I was told TODAY when I was being terminated they needed someone to lead the team and hit the ground running asap. When I interviewed with this company, none of these expectations were expressed otherwise I would have not taken the role. ",0

> After Trump took office, DJ Patil watched with wonder as the data disappeared across the federal government. Both the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior removed from their websites the links to climate change data. The USDA removed the inspection reports of businesses accused of animal abuse by the government. The new acting head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Mick Mulvaney, said he wanted to end public access to records of consumer complaints against financial institutions. Two weeks after Hurricane Maria, statistics that detailed access to drinking water and electricity in Puerto Rico were deleted from the FEMA website. In a piece for FiveThirtyEight, Clare Malone and Jeff Asher pointed out that the first annual crime report released by the FBI under Trump was missing nearly three-quarters of the data tables from the previous year. ‚ÄúAmong the data missing from the 2016 report is information on arrests, the circumstances of homicides (such as the relationships between victims and perpetrators), and the only national estimate of annual gang murders,‚Äù they wrote. Trump said he wanted to focus on violent crime, and yet was removing the most powerful tool for understanding it.

> 
> And as for the country‚Äôs first chief data scientist‚Äîwell, the Trump administration did not show the slightest interest in him. ‚ÄúI basically knew that these guys weren‚Äôt going to listen to us,‚Äù said DJ, ‚Äúso we created these exit memos. The memos showed that this stuff pays for itself a thousand times over.‚Äù He hoped the memos might give the incoming administration a sense of just how much was left to be discovered in the information the government had collected. There were questions crying out for answers: for instance, what was causing the boom in traffic fatalities? The Department of Transportation had giant pools of data waiting to be searched. One hundred Americans were dying every day in car crashes. The thirty-year trend of declining traffic deaths has reversed itself dramatically. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on,‚Äù said DJ. ‚ÄúDistracted driving? Heavier cars? Faster driving? More driving? Bike lanes?‚Äù
> 

> The knowledge to be discovered in government data might shift the odds in much of American life. You could study the vaccination data, for instance, and create heat maps for disease. ‚ÄúIf you could randomly drop someone with measles somewhere in the United States, where would you have the biggest risk of an epidemic?‚Äù said DJ. ‚ÄúWhere are epidemics waiting to happen? These questions, when you have access to data, you can do things. Everyone is focused on how data is a weapon. Actually, if we don‚Äôt have data, we‚Äôre screwed.‚Äù
> 

> His memos were never read, DJ suspects. At any rate, he‚Äôs never heard a peep about them. And he came to see there was nothing arbitrary or capricious about the Trump administration‚Äôs attitude toward public data. Under each act of data suppression usually lay a narrow commercial motive: a gun lobbyist, a coal company, a poultry company. ‚ÄúThe NOAA webpage used to have a link to weather forecasts,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt was highly, highly popular. I saw it had been buried. And I asked: Now, why would they bury that?‚Äù Then he realized: the man Trump nominated to run NOAA thought that people who wanted a weather forecast should have to pay him for it. There was a rift in American life that was now coursing through American government. It wasn‚Äôt between Democrats and Republicans. It was between the people who were in it for the mission, and the people who were in it for the money.

320,I hire data scientists - this is the stuff this forum doesn't discuss enough...:,277,3m78k1,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/3m78k1/i_hire_data_scientists_this_is_the_stuff_this/,114,"Hi,

I put a post up a week or so ago about how I hire some junior data scientists - I was actually struggling because I usually hire more senior positions. 
&nbsp;

I got some *great* feedback - and thank you to everyone who commented. At the time though, I put up a comment saying that I felt that this subreddit, and others like the ML one, while great at covering SOME of the area's in data science, left gaps in other area's that really matter in real world scenarios.  I said I would write something about it.
&nbsp;


I wrote an obscenely long post about it, and then it didn't post properly (operator error). So, rather than re-type that essay, I thought I would do something at a higher level and then answer questions.
&nbsp;


Lets set some context first.
I work in private industry - a big(ish) UK financial services company. I do a mix of internal R&D type work - stuff our own teams ask for - and stuff that clients ask for. So - everything that follows is in that context - it is a bit different if your working for a start up company. It is very different if your working in acedemia. It's very different if your working for government agencies. Keep that in mind.
&nbsp;


I think this forum is awesome - I lurk every day. However, there is stuff that makes up the majority of my life and my guys life that doesn't get discussed here which - as there are so many people posting about moving into this world, and looking for jobs in this world - I think is an issue.
&nbsp;


Here are some things which I think need to be discussed here more. Also - if you can show me this stuff on a CV or in an interview, it will jump you straight to the top of the pile. 
&nbsp;



**1) You are ridiculously expensive - show me how you will add value.**
There is a team in every private company that all other departments fear and dread. They are called ""Finance"" and they are the bane of every managers life. They apply basic mathematics in bizarre ways, and they will constantly demand that managers either spend more or less money than they are. The managers will NEVER win.
&nbsp;



When it comes to head count it boils down to profit margin. Lets say I am recruiting for a senior data scientist and will pay then $100,000 ( really - thats a bit on the low side, but it makes a simple calculation). Lets say my company runs at a 20% profit margin. In the world of Finance, this means that that person needs to add $500,000 of value- not $100,000 -  before they break even. You may think this is crazy - but that is because you are a mere mortal and do not know Finance Maths. You don't have to agree with it - you just have to live with it.
&nbsp;



What does that mean for you the data guy? You need to **Get Stuff Done**. You probably aren't going to be getting your own sales leads and doing your own deals - but you need to add value. And that really means ***BEING PRAGMATIC***
&nbsp;



Some work needs to be *absolutely* perfect. These are the places where you spend the extra week tweaking your model for that last .1% of accuracy. It's where you are expected to go read papers to find a new clustering algorithm that will reduce the over-fit by .5% and you get a month to try it and deal with it.
&nbsp;



But - a lot of stuff doesn't need perfection. If you need to join two sets of data as a one off task, then it doesn't matter if you use SAS, a lump of PERL, bookmarks in TextPad, Excel, Python. No one cares - you just need to get it done. If you need to know whether two elements of data correlate, then often a basic regression is ""good enough"", and will save you a couple of hours.
&nbsp;



*What does this mean?*
You'll know which hat you need to wear - but when you're wearing your ""just get it done"" hat - which will be more often than your ""Get it perfect"" hat - you need to a toolbag full of quick work arounds and practical methods. If something takes 100 lines of SAS, 10 lines of Python or 2 lines of Perl... don't go the SAS route. If you need to eyeball and juggle 10,000 records then you could drop it out as a set of tables with R, or you could do it in Excel. I know it's not cool - but finance don't care - so your manager doesn't - so you don't. Get good at this stuff. Be pragmatic. Know when to have a ""Good enough"" mentality. And show it.....
&nbsp;



**2) Learn to deal with junk**
Real world data is, usually, rubbish. You need to be *REALLY* good at dealing with rubbish.
Examples - I have about 2 petabytes of data coming from about 8,000 sources. The absolute best raw data set has a 2% error rate. The worst has a 75% error rate. Those figures are better than a lot of other groups are dealing with. You don't get to complain or get someone else to clean it up - you need to be good at adapting to it. REALLY REALLY REALLY good.
&nbsp;


That data comes in to me in perhaps 1500 schemas and formats. No provider - ever - sticks to a schema. EVER. *EVER!* So, I need to be able to join data that arrived in EBSDIC to stuff that turns up in weirdly compressed AVRO. (tip here - learn to love CSV - it's a perfect intermediate - as is an SQLite table). Looking across my data sets, I can see a minimum of 21 different data structures for Date:Time. What ever your going to do, your going to use dates and times. So - thats something you need to be slick with. Remember Point 1) - this is ""Get It Done"" stuff. 
&nbsp;


Also - a lot of data science is speculative - your going to have 10 idea's for every 1 actual piece of solid work you do. For those idea's, you're usually going to need to crash a data sample together, give it an eyeballing, patch it up a bit, do some basic work and see if it's practical. That means 9 out of 10 of those tasks you do will be disposable - so just Get It Done.
&nbsp;


All of this is probably best described as ""Data Monkeying"" - your not doing science - your monkeying with data. Realistically over the course of a year, you will probably spend 50% of your time doing Data Monkey work rather than real Data Science. 
&nbsp;


*What does that mean?*
When i recruit a data scientist, they absolutely, completely and totally MUST be damn good data monkeys. I'm counting on you being able to do the data monkeying in 50% of your day, not 90% of your day, so that the other 50% of your day you can do the ""Data Science"" bit and actually add value - cos the Finance Team are watching...
&nbsp;


It's not cool, you don't get a conference speech out of it, and it doesn't get you a bonus, but unless you are dealing with a single source of data, a good deal of your life is going to be spent dealing with this mess. You need to 1) get good at it and 2) not take too long dealing with it.
&nbsp;


If I had god like powers over this Sub I would make it so that 50% or more of the posts are people trading tips, cookbooks, idea's and lots of practice data sets so they are getting good at data monkeying, rather than Data Science. Definitely less cool - but will make the biggest impact to your working lives.
&nbsp;


Some examples of data monkeying: Flicking between data structures and schemas. Recasting data. parsing data. Changing time series - compressing and interpolation of time events -Spliting data. Joining data. Dealing with common types of tricky data - like names, address structures, dates, time series. blah blah blah.
&nbsp;


Fastest way to get your CV to the top of the pile - make sure that I can see your data monkeying as well as your data science skills.
&nbsp;


**3) Learn to tell a story and not be scary.**
Your going to work with all sorts of people - Sales, IT, Operations and lots of managers. And you will intimidate EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. Whether you are or not actually scary, when you walk into a room, they will automatically assume that you are the brightest person in that room and that your going to baffle them. 
&nbsp;


Some people - a minority - will try and get close to you and learn from you. The vast majority will react to their intimidation by either not listening to you at all ( many managers ) or feeling annoyed by you ( most sales people). It's not anyone's fault - it's just human nature. If you break out the big words, the jargon, the acronyms and present them with a 19 page excel spreadsheet you do nothing but reinforce those pre-conceptions. Downside for you is that it's harder to rapidly climb the career ladder. Downside for your boss is that it's harder for you to show 5x or 20x your salary as value - which means more discussions with Finance ( shudder)
&nbsp;



*Two easy fixes and one sneaky fix:*
**Fix 1** - Learn to tell a story. Seriously - when you tell people about your work give it a beginning, a middle and an end. ""I was asked X, I did A, B, C and D, it looks like the answer is Y"". You might not need to do this for people for people who read this sub, but this is humanising you. Another thing - put it in context ... I.e. ""A client has X as a problem... I did A, B, C and D. It looks like the answer is Y because it helps the client due to....blah blah blah..""
&nbsp;




**fix 2** - present in the right way for the audience.
Some people can deal with lots of data. Some people insist on it. Some people are intimiated by it. Some people genuinely see it as you trying to hide behind a snow of nonsense.  For example - if your doing something for a finance group, or a bunch of actuaries - you NEED the 19 page spreadsheet. And you'd better be damn sure every single cell is correct. If you were presenting to a senior sales manager, then you want a few pages of Powerpoint with big diagrams and a few bullets per page maximum. Thats not because the sales guy is less clever - it's just what they need to consume information. 
&nbsp;



You don't need to be a graphic designer - but you do need an acceptable grasp of displaying data. Reading FlowingData. Read blogs. Practice. Learn to make an acceptable spreadsheet. Learn to make an acceptable PowerPoint. Play with MathPlotLib/SAS-Graph/Plotly..... Again - you don't need to be amazing - you don't need to be a master data visualisation expert - ""good enough"" - but that still needs practice.
&nbsp;



**Sneaky fix:** Remember how you intimidate people because they think your a genius? Ask them a question about something they know - ""What do you think the client will do with this"" or ""How will HR use this data to plan the company party?"". Give them a set of options for something even if you make them up  Doesn't matter what it is - just ask one so they can contribute. Practice doing it subtly.
&nbsp;

 I work in Real Estate, and currently the only function the C-level staff sees is to pump out ""research"" that hits the market and shows what we're capable of.

I'm not solving problems. I am going through datasets to see what models and ""assumptions"" I can solve; showcasing our ability to use AI.

When I asked, ""wouldn't investors ask right from the beginning, ""what's the point?"" or ""what are they trying to solve?"""" I was rewarded with the response, ""investors are too dumb to know what AI is.""

Oh the contrary, I think WE'RE too dumb to know what AI is.

My department spends money, and we haven't received a strip of evidence that has shown my work has had any significant impact.

I offered to some cost modelling. I've proposed to do affordability modelling for an investor, however it all fell on dead ears.

Apparently investors don't care where they're putting their money?

EDIT: It's like getting a doctor to showcase his skills by performing surgery on people he thinks are sick. Why don't I invest in time on investors to show the QUALITY of our work?",0

We work with very large data sources and have solid infrastructure, but the technical skills of the team are very low. The team is all data scientists (myself included) with decent theoretical knowledge, but minimal experience with good coding/development practices.

I've worked as a (junior) software engineer in the past, and although I consider my knowledge to be pretty modest, it far exceeds that of the rest of the team. I'd like to introduce better practies to my current team, such as code reviews and writing tests, but I've never worked anywhere that had a great approach to development so I'm not sure how to go about it.

We mainly work on projects individually, that are usually unique and have little in common, so there's not much standardisation that can be done. We use git, but basically just commit straight to master, and most of our work is analsyis rather than anything that's productionised. It's rare for multiple people to work on the same codebase and even rarer to do so at the same time. We don't really use development methodologies like scrum/kanban, as we mostly work independently so people just manage their own work.

Any thoughts on where the best place to start would be? I'm not sure where to begin given the nature of our work and the low technical proficiency of the team. I want to help the rest of the team improve their coding, increase knowledge sharing, and generally work more efficiently. Thanks!",0

------------------------------------------------

Edit to answer the major questions being asked:

First of all thank you so much for the love! Really appreciate it.

My background - Stats undergrad from a rigorous school, no MS or PHD. Got a job as a business analyst, realized I could do more with my skills. 

After that, I hate to be a cliche but what got me the furthest was projects. Find reasons to get excited about the technology, build projects. Go to hackathons, build projects. Add stuff to your blog, github, etc. There are no MOOCs or blogposts that will get you the experience of actually trying to process and model real data with real data problems.

Once you do enough of these, you can start to talk data science with other professionals at a level of comfort that signals that you're not bullshitting just to get a job. 

One other piece of advice I have is to push yourself at your current role in the right direction. I realized that while my current job wasn't a data science role, there were non technical things I could do to help become a better data scientist eventually - things like getting really good at SQL queries, building visualizations and focusing on story telling around the data (even just in powerpoint format). 

Combining this with the more technical data science related stuff in my own time helped a lot - the business side of data science is underrated but often what employers are really looking for.

The last thing I wanted to share is that it was not easy, and interviewing is really hard. I was doing several personal projects, built a blog, participated in hackathons, participated in kaggle challenges, going to meetups, linkedin, etc. and I still bombed at the beginning. Doing these things got my foot in the door - I had the opportunity to interview for top companies such as Facebook but I tanked at the beginning. It was embarrassing and humbling - but do not give up! Take interviews whenever you get a chance just to practice those skills and eventually it will become more natural.

That's all for now, can add more based on interest!

Edit #2: Remembered one more thing. There are going to be haters on your journey. People will gatekeep, claim that you're not doing 'real data science', or say the market is overflooded with data scientist wannabes. There's probably some truth there, but I had to keep reminding myself that everyone starts somewhere, and in the end this is just a career choice for now. Not the end of the world - ignore them and keep pressing on.

Data engineering is a very important field, but it is new, often under-appreciated, and rarely discussed relative to its close cousin Data Science. I still remembered the first time I was trying to learn Luigi, an open-sourced project from Spotify for ETL, and I struggled a lot to find accessible materials.

Having worked at Airbnb for a few years, I was really fortunate to learn data engineering from some of the best data engineers in the industry. As such, I would like to share my experience and learnings so this topic can become more accessible to others.

You can find my final post of the series on Medium: https://medium.com/@rchang/a-beginners-guide-to-data-engineering-the-series-finale-2cc92ff14b0. If you are completely new to DE, you might consider reading Part I & Part II of the series as well.

I don't know how other companies DS team is, but I always imagine a Data scientist has having many opportunities throughout the year to work on different types of models, from regressions, to trees, to unsupervised, to AI, etc etc.

For anyone that works as a DS, outside of the EDA and preprocessing work that you work on, are there a lot of variety in your modelling work, or is it just wishful thinking?",0

""Really good people see through to the role, past the title.""¬†

&#x200B;

Just some food for thought.

&#x200B;

A debate on PhD yes vs PhD no would be one of those sterile how-long-is-a-piece-of-string type of questions, because you cannot generalise. But one thing I have noticed is that people with a very theoretical background tend to struggle to adapt to a business world in which it is often best to spend 1 hour to get 90% of the answer, as they'd rather spend 3 days to get the full answer. Which isn't to say that a PhD is useless, of course not - I just mean that PhD graduates must realise that the business world is very different from academia.

343,One of the useful skills that I've learned,258,hvc6qs,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hvc6qs/one_of_the_useful_skills_that_ive_learned/,31,"Since moving into the DS field roughly 4 years ago, and having worked on/for a handful of different teams/companies, I think one of the best skills I've picked up is being able to tell people what CAN'T be done.

It sounds pessimistic on face value, but in industry I find it to be a very practical skill. In my experience, upper management or outside departments have an overinflated perception of the capabilities of data science in general, but also data science capabilities within the organization. 

I've found this to be true working for very large corporations as well as non-profits. In my opinion, being able to honestly and succinctly articulate the realistic capabilities of the team can drastically improve efficiency and reduce wasted time/energy. 

Again, in my experience, explaining in blunt terms what can/ can't be done to non-technical or not-very-technical is the way to go. I typically start out very broad and explain why what their asking is a bad idea. If that doesn't work, I get more technical and also try to put it into a dollars/man-hours cost benefit type of analysis. Typically once you explain technically why it can't be done OR why it doesn't make sense in terms of money or time, then people start to understand better.

Using this type of strategy from the very outset is the best way to go. The last thing you want to do is overpromise and underperform.

An example, since this is a bit ambiguous, I was working on a team and we were contacted by another department to ""create an algorithm that sorts our emails into various categories."" They had heard from someone that text classification could save them time... Or something like that is what I gathered. Our team knew it was a BS request right off the bat, but my boss was overruled by a superior within the company. We had several (useless) meetings with them where they spilled out their reasons why they needed this to be done.

Long story short, it turns out that they only had 500 emails and there were no real defined categories to put them into. It wasn't until we explained to them that 1) this model would take longer than just going thru the emails by hand 2) would likely not be very accurate and 3) basically cost a teams worth of hours to complete. Ultimately common sense prevailed and they did it by hand.",0

I'd like to share with you a nice little story. I've recently been working on a difficult scoring problem that determined a rank from numerous features. There were numerous issues: which features were most important, did it make sense to have so many features, do we condense them, do we take the mean and so on. I had been working on this problem for weeks, and after numerous measurements, reports, reading and testing, I conked out -- I gave up. 

Man, Data Science was done for me; I was so over it. I started talking more with my colleagues in different departments, primarily in PR. I just felt like doing something else for a few days. I asked one of my colleagues in PR, ""so, what would you do if you had to rank X, Y, and Z?"" ""Hmm... I'm not so sure, I think I would be more interested in Z than X, why is X even necessary?"" She was right. Statistically, X was absolutely necessary in many of my modes. My boss thought this was the key to solving our problem, why would she think it's unnecessary? It turns out... as Data Scientists, we weren't the ones using the product. My colleague -- bless her soul -- is exactly our target audience. We were so in solutions mode, we forgot to just think about the problem and WHOM it concerns. 

I decided to take a walk and put pen to paper. I even asked the barista at the local cafe. It was so obvious. 

We were solving the WRONG problem the whole time -- well, at least we weren't making it any easier for ourselves.

To all of the great DS minds out there, sometimes we need to stop and reset. 

Problems are realised in different ways; it's our job as Data Scientists to understand who the realisation is for.

Now that I'm studying masters in data analytics I see the benefits of R. It's used in academia, even had a professor tell me off for using python on a presentation lol.

I know how to use libraries like pandas, matplotlib, sklearn etc. I know how to import and use models such as Random Forest, XGBoost etc. Right now I feel like what I need most is practice and to get actual code on my github.

Well, a couple weeks ago I signed up for a competition from one of the big companies in my country for their Big Data school. The entry test was really rough (tens of thousadns of missing values, hashed data with about 5k values) I attempted it last year and failed spectacularly, and although I passed it this time I failed at the next stages of the selection process where I was asked a lot about how I tackled certain problems with the dataset. I realised that I didn't even think about a lot of these problems and I only did some pretty basic data cleaning. It's clear to me that at this stage, this is my biggest weak point.

What do you feel is the best way to learn it? I want to get in and do some actual practice with datasets, but I'm pretty intimidated right now. I would appreciate any advice and thanks in advance.

What to do?,243,gap9nc,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gap9nc/seeking_advice_my_boss_is_not_giving_me_enough/,75,"I work as a data scientist at a medium-sized company (with \~200 employees). I've been with the company for a little over 4 months. My salary is $90K/year in a city where the cost of living is relatively cheap. (For perspective, $1200/month for 2-bedroom-2-bathroom apartment.) I have a BI analyst as my boss and I have another boss who's a BI director.

The BI team in our office is small. Just 3 of us in the office. The issue I have is that my bosses don't understand the complexity of running a valid analysis, which is forcing me to cut corners and produce sub-par quality work. Those sub-par quality analyses then get criticized by people in other departments (e.g. finance people, data scientists in other offices, etc.) and it makes me look like an idiot.

Don't get me wrong. My bosses are hardworking, smart people. They can write complex SQL code and make stunningly beautiful Tableau dashboards. However, they don't have any statistical background to properly design studies and go through the proper procedures to come to accurate conclusions. But they care too much about how beautiful the presentations must be (font, color, company branding, etc.) and meeting deadlines instead of focusing on the important stuffs, like valid experimental procedures and properly separating out correlation from causation.

I would say that the overall company culture is very healthy. The CEO is super transparent about the company matters. Everyone is very open and caring. The company sent a lot of care packages during the quarantine for the employees and they also host weekly fun company-wide activities. They give great medical and health benefits as well as PTO.

I thought about quitting because not having enough time and resources that I need to do my job is making me look incompetent. I haven't quit yet because:

1. I don't think many other companies are hiring amid this quarantine crisis,
2. I have a criminal background so I'm not sure if there is any other company that's willing to risk hiring me.

What should I do? At this rate, I'm gonna continue looking like an idiot and maybe I'll lose my job.

TLDR: My boss is not giving me enough time to do my analyses so I'm producing sub-par quality work. What should I do?

374,Mid career advice for an ML generalist: Update,236,daxwf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/daxwf4/mid_career_advice_for_an_ml_generalist_update/,24,"[A few weeks ago I posted that I was having trouble with mid-senior level interviews.](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/d0qz6h/mid_career_advice_for_an_ml_generalist/) Since then I‚Äôve changed a few things and had much better responses (3 onsite invitations and 2 offers). I've just signed an offer that I‚Äôm pretty happy with, and wanted to update you on some of the things that I think helped the most.

# Company size

I was applying pretty randomly to a lot of different size companies, turns out my sweet spot seems to be startups with 10-20 employees who don‚Äôt have an ML manager yet. (I don't have enough management experience to go for manager roles at larger companies). I think this is because I‚Äôve had too many experiences with bad managers that I don‚Äôt really trust them, so I probably put out a prickly vibe in interviews that puts people off.

# Age(ism)

I do a lot better when interviewed by older people, like 40-50+, they seem to have more respect for my PhD and life experience rather than just trying to catch me out on something I don‚Äôt know off the top of my head. Luckily the tech bubble (e.g. 20-year old founders of [juice startups](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bizcarson/2017/09/01/silicon-valleys-infamous-400-juicer-startup-is-shutting-down/)) is settling down, I think I read somewhere that most successful startups are actually founded by 40+ year olds, so hopefully the industry will go more back to the way it was in the 80s and 90s.

# Statistics

I‚Äôve never really got statistics on a deep level (my PhD is in pure math) so have always struggled with stats questions in interviews, e.g. ‚Äúthere are two groups of users each one does a certain number of clicks per day, how do you know if one is more than the other.‚Äù Stats just seemed like a random bag of z scores and t tests and I don‚Äôt even really believe in p-values; I‚Äôd remember enough to stumble my way thorough, and then say something about bootstrapping confidence intervals when I couldn‚Äôt, but it made me come across as pretty weak. What turned it around for me was reading ‚ÄúStatistical Rethinking‚Äù by Richard McElreath: writing out the equations for statistical models gives me confidence when I‚Äôm talking ( I come from a math background) and then I can just say that I would run MCMC to get the coefficients.

I‚Äôve also screwed up a few interviews with time series data from sensors (outlier detection etc) ... I still don‚Äôt really know how to approach these.

# ML models

This was one of the biggest things I was doing wrong in retrospect. When I was asked ‚Äútell me something you‚Äôve done that you‚Äôre proud of‚Äù I‚Äôd tell stories about powerful business results I‚Äôd achieved using simple models like heuristics, logistic regression or random forests together with more organisational things like clarifying metrics and objective functions with stakeholders, product/design thinking, evolving data-labeling practices, and testing models in production as soon as possible.

Lol turns out people don‚Äôt want to hear about any of this, maybe it made them think that I just plug data into a black box and don‚Äôt understand how it works? Anyway things turned around for me when I dropped all the business stuff and started just talking about (the one time) when I read a research paper, implemented the algorithm in PyTorch and got a meaningful gain in accuracy.

# Engineering

You guys were right, I didn't need more engineering experience, I'm already pretty strong for a data scientist, I was just doubting myself due to my current company (which doesn't have a data science org) gaslighting me into taking a lower pay grade.

Anyway hope this is useful to some of you, definitely going to approach my next job search differently although maybe things will be different by then anyway and I might be going for more management-level roles. Have any of you had similar experiences?",0

Just wanted to share three quick pointers I think might be valuable as someone who got an entry level analyst role on a data science team at a start-up and is now hiring for one:

1) *Data cleaning, data cleaning, data cleaning*: These are the golden words on the resume. Most companies today are trying to apply ML to really complicated real-world problems, which means messy data. If you talk about experience where you have cleaned messy real-world data in detail, that will put you ahead of other candidates.

2) *Generic Projects*: We all know them: housing price regression, MNIST, the flower one, Twitter sentiment analyses, MovieLens recommendation system, etc. Having done these isn't *bad* necessarily, but to someone with who has been around the block of online machine learning courses, these aren't all that impressive. Filling out your resume with original, even if they are relatively simple, projects and models that incorporate data cleaning is much more attention-grabbing.

3) *Why??*: I don't really mind people who message me on LinkedIn, deduce my work email or go to the effort of writing cover letters but you aren't really doing much for yourself if all you are saying is ""Hey I saw the job, I think I am qualified, can I have the job?"". That is what everyone who is applying is saying, you're just being more annoying about it. If you look into our company, even just regurgitate our mission statement in your cover letter, it at least shows you aren't just spraying and praying. I would be more likely to consider someone less qualified who communicated why they want this job, not just a job.

As I [29M] join the workforce and will focus on having a family.,232,edtagd,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/edtagd/possibly_controversial_what_is_the_best_mindset/,136,"I apologize in advance if anything I say is controversial. I'm genuinely curious about the future of this line of career and don't mean to offend anyone from any country.

I'm currently 29M, about to finish my PhD in a STEM field. A huge lesson I've learned, being involved in research, startups and big corporations is that programmers and coders are just a workforce, which can be bought, used and then put on the shelf. The availability of good programmers is growing every year, especially with most software tools being freely available and huge competition from programmers from developing countries such as India and China. Additionally, I can clearly see things headed towards automation of programming.  Expertise in a tool-set might lead to short-term job prospects, but one can easily be replaced/automated. I'm planning a career in medical data-science. The deep learning models I'm building now for my PhD won't be a novelty very soon as computers get more powerful and infrastructures are setup to perform standard machine learning and deep learning at the click of a button/ call of a function, instead of needing to develop them in Tensorflow/PyTorch/Caffe/Scikit-Learn/R. Platforms such as R, Weka etc are headed that way currently.

There's a few things I've figured which will be difficult to automate and requires domain expertise and good communication skills. I'd love any comments on the following ways to secure a good career for the next 10-15 years. This is pure speculation of course:

1. Data Engineer: Expertise in the pre-learning stage, involving data pre-processing, cleaning, feature building  and maintenance of the data pipeline. This requires domain knowledge and cannot easily be performed by a generic data-scientist. This seems to be the most technically challenging and interesting.
2. Data Analyst: Great communication skills to convince the stakeholders/managers using the information provided by the data scientist. This seems quite future-proof however, the job focus seems to shift more towards communication, relying on soft-skills with a good working knowledge of data science. Requires good understanding of statistics. But having seen my friends attend multiple meetings trying to explain the meaning of statistics to the managers, I'm not sure this one is for me. 
3. Manager: Managing a team of data engineers, scientists, analysts. One level removed from the analysts. Less involvement with technology and more with people management skills. Personally, this doesn't interest me. I can see the appeal of this position for others though.
4. Data Scientist: Feel like this is at most risk of being automated. The models being used can be put in a standard infrastructure for ensemble methods, making the process of creating models from scratch redundant. Hyper-customized models however, would still be in demand.
5. Multi-disciplinary Data Science Application Engineer: This has been the most interesting discovery. Use of machine learning/statistical/deep learning techniques to develop a model that can be used as part of another ecosystem. For example, using a well-trained NLP sentiment analyzer for prediction of body posture and using MoCap for validation. Essentially, combining multiple technologies for building a product, instead of pure data-science for reporting/business intelligence. My PhD has been along these lines so far.

Hope I'm thinking along the correct lines. Seeing the fast changing ecosystem of A.I./M.L./Data-science got me thinking about future career prospects as I enter the stage in my life to increase my focus on building a family and providing for them. Thus, limiting the amount of time I can dedicate to keeping on top of technologies/trends and require career stability. I'm extremely open to any suggestions/criticisms/corrections.

My supervisor gave me a task to finish a ""spec"" without really clarifying it. We have a task to perform automatic summation on certain parts of the data storage place. However it's not an easy task.

The part that is frustrating is that there's no real direction. They haven't given me full access to the data storage place. Nor have they spent any time explaining how the product or data is stored or even what the column titles and abbreviations mean. Meanwhile, I'm supposed to finish this ""spec"". Every time I finish it, they change what I'm working on.

After a week I've still not had a clear direction and my final draft is supposed to be done Wednesday. They recently gave me an Excel document to solve this problem, which I did. But didn't tell me what we're going to implement it with, so no idea if my excel solving is even going to be used as it could be used in SQL. 

The job required me to know Python, R, and SQL. But so far when brining any ideas using those programs to my boss, I'm told we haven't had any plans to use any of those programs yet.

Is this normal?

At random.ai we enthusiastically follow a well-designed execution methodology that has been developed and calibrated over many years. Software development methodologies come and go, and perspectives change. We embrace the Agile SDLC. The beautiful thing about agile is to adopt it, all you have to do is say you‚Äôre agile. And the more you talk about being agile, the more agile you are.

In order to achieve lightning fast delivery speed, we jump directly into development and skip the analysis, requirements and design steps (which are common phases in other, less effective, methodologies). In order to ensure alignment and rapid cycle time, we set milestone deadlines and scope before wasting time on understanding the complexity of the business problem at hand. A key success factor is that the decision makers and product/project plan owners have little or no knowledge of the technological challenges that will be encountered during future phases. To build great technology, we strategically organize our execution teams to minimize the number of people who are writing the code. Our rule of thumb is for every one technologist (i.e. developer, engineer or data scientist), there should be at least four non-technical project team members. This will provide the necessary capacity for these additional resources to determine **what** the technologist will do, **when** they should do it by, and most importantly, **how** they should do it. An important characteristic for successful projects is for the project team to collect a backlog of diverse, unrelated, and unclear tasks and assign them to the developers the moment they think of them. The more our developers and data scientists multi-task, the more tasks can be completed.

A core priority for a sustainable revenue stream on existing products is maintenance- the time spent maintaining existing code and pipelines. Our strategy on investing in maintenance is to do none at all - we can maintain a massive pipeline of new product development by not getting bogged down and distracted doing preemptive maintenance on legacy code. We have rapid, lightweight prioritization of fixing legacy code- instead of crawling through old code that‚Äôs already working, it‚Äôs better to wait for it to break and allow our clients to discover the problem and raise it to us. This makes prioritization incredibly easy- once the problem is raised, we mobilize resources immediately to fix the problem. Again, this aligns with our philosophy that multi-tasking developers are productive developers.

We find that our most successful project teams and middle managers are always thinking of ways create value for clients faster. We even have a special phrase for these internally: ""short cuts"". So many companies fall victim to spending time building extensible, easily modifiable systems that have staying power over time. Those companies are guaranteed to never reach a billion dollar valuation. Things like robust error handling, load/unit/regression testing, modularization of code, documentation- all distractions preventing you from realizing value faster. For example, we recently had a case where we needed to implement a critical bug fix. A sales rep had the idea of a short cut that led to an incredibly fast turn-around of one week- great ideas really do come from anywhere! We know the short cut was decisively faster than the slow traditional route, because we had to do the fix to the same code three times, each took the same amount of time- one week, and the senior developer‚Äôs original estimate was two weeks! This is the out-of-the-box thinking that separates good companies from great ones.

Any competent person in the data products or AI/ML industry will tell you the same thing- having a well-thought-out data quality strategy is a survival necessity. We achieved a 100% efficiency gain in our quality assurance efforts by removing them entirely from our dev cycle. We haven‚Äôt failed a test case since the decision, and we‚Äôre getting products out the door faster because of it.

The last, but certainly not least, critical component of our execution methodology and philosophy is our talent. Our people are our greatest asset. After years of trying out different org structures- we have, what I believe to be, the truly optimal structure and our key to success is our management team. With respect to head count, we like to have as many mid-level managers as individual contributors. This ensures our individual contributors have the support they need: one half of the company is working tirelessly to support the other half who is doing actual work. Our managers really roll up their sleeves and get into the weeds- really managing all the way down at the most micro level possible.

I hope that you too can gain success using these philosophies and strategies I‚Äôve shared. Here at random.ai, we‚Äôre excited to be disrupting the future of cloud native, deep learning powered blockchain knowledge graph data lakes - our CNDLPBKGDL offering which is releasing to beta next year. We‚Äôre disrupting the world by disrupting ourselves- because at random.ai, we're solving yesterday‚Äôs problems tomorrow, because tomorrow, today will be yesterday.

Edit: so apparently it‚Äôs not entirely clear to all readers that this is a satirical piece. I have been in a data science/ developer roles for the last eight years, and have seen these trends at multiple companies. All of the above are symptomatic of not knowing how to manage a technology company or technology teams. The satire in this comes from the absurdity of the ‚Äústrategy‚Äù defined above- nobody would actually brag about doing some of these things, but companies fall into it via ignorance, politics, or whatever reason.",0

But if you are considering multiple job offers, it's worth asking if they have open office layouts.   They're quite popular with some companies (mostly because it's cheap and easy to cram in extra people I suspect).  They claim it enhances ""collaboration"" but that's effectively a lie in my experience.

But I am here to tell you, I hate it.  I work in an office where there are 3 workstations side-by-side along a long table/desk with maybe 3 feet between them (occupied by you own personal cubby reminiscent of elementary school) and facing a second such desk so your monitors are literally 2 inches from the person sitting at the desk across from you.  And five feet behind you is the back of the person at the next row of desk.

I cannot exaggerate how much this sucks.   If any one of the 9 people immediately surrounding you is on the phone or talking to someone, you know about it.  God help you if someone has an annoying habit of humming or something. I don't actually know anyone at work who prefers the open office to what we used to have (cubes) and we pretty much all agree it has hurt productivity.

409,A Warning on University of Michigan Coursera Courses,226,bcgoy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bcgoy7/a_warning_on_university_of_michigan_coursera/,77,"Hi all,

As a person who's first exposure to data science was on Coursera, it has a somewhat special place in my heart. The Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization was a great way to get myself introduced into the world of data science, and the further I got through the course, the more I felt like I wanted to do this for a living. And I managed to pull that off! The only downside is that R is my specialty, and I currently work in a predominately Python atmosphere. So I thought what better way to spruce up my Python techniques than taking some more Coursera courses, right?

&#x200B;

Well, to my dismay, the University of Michigan's Data Science with Python classes are a disorganized mess. The professors clearly haven't updated things in the course for years. The videos had errors galore, there were errors in the assignments that we were given, and the notes were filled with outdated code that has been done away with since Python has been updated. It's one thing to encourage users to hop on the discussion forum for better learning and discussion between peers and professionals, but I found the discussion forum was just filled with ways to get around the errors that the instructors left behind for the user to deal with. While these were not meant to be courses in Python debugging, they turned out to be that way.

&#x200B;

So to make a long story short, if you're interested in learning Python for data science, I can not recommend these courses. This is not to say that everything on Coursera is garbage. As I mentioned, the Johns Hopkins classes arguably got me the job I have today. But if you're jumping in to these ideas for the first time, the University of Michigan does not make data science a fun subject to learn. Instead, they turn it into a specialization of jumping through hoops to get a certification, and needless to say, that's not how people learn.

&#x200B;

If you've had better experiences in other courses, please comment below to help fellow readers out! I'd be curious to know as well!

&#x200B;

EDIT: A good point was made, below in the comments. To be more specific, the courses I took were the first three in the specialization, ie.  Intro to Data Science with Python, Applied Plotting, Charting, and Data Representation in Python, and Applied Machine Learning in Python.",0

I learned last summer that I really have a passion for data science and decided I would try for that for my next internship. Last year I got 5+ interviews right away when I applied to local software engineering internships, so I figured okay I will be able to get  something, I am capable and hard working. Turns out that's not true and nobody wants to hire me even though I hold a lot of the qualifications for a data science internship. I've applied to over 60 places since August and have gotten over 15 rejections so far and only one place was willing to give me a coding test which they rejected me after. I am so  downtrodden and defeated, I have no clue what I am doing wrong.

I've  talked to multiple professors, HR at work, career services, and they all have said that I am doing everything right in their eyes. I'm starting research next semester with my AI professor and I am planning to make a chatbot over winter break, so those will help my skills but I am not sure how much of that I can really even show off on a job application. I am also retaking the AI class I already took and got an A in because my professor is changing it to include machine learning. I'm also taking some 400 level stats classes next year.

Eventually I want to go to grad school for data science. I just want to start now gaining experience because I really enjoy doing and learning abut this stuff. Am I just not competitive enough? I know I don't have much experience but isn't that want an internship is for? It's so so so disheartening, it's really hard not to question my capability of being in this field and if I should just stick with software engineering. I really would appreciate some advice and guidance. Thank you.

Lots of things can go wrong here, especially when I revert back to the original and I may forget about line 120, something like that, or if I have to do multiple segments, I dont have to scroll up and down so many times

As an engineer with a good background in computer science, I've always seen these tools as a bad influencer in the industry. I have also spent countless hours arguing against them. 

Primarily because they do not scale properly, are not maintainable, limit your hiring pool and eventually you will still need to write *some* code for the truly custom approaches.

Also unfortunately, there is a small sector of data scientists who only operate within that tool set. These data scientists tend not to have a deep understanding of what they are building and maintaining.

However it feels like these tools are getting stronger and stronger as time passes. And I am recently considering ""if you can't beat them, join them"", avoiding hours of fighting off management, and instead focusing on how to seek the best possible implementation.

So my questions are:

* Do you use no code DS tools in your job? Do you like them? What is the benefit over R/Python? Do you think the proliferation of these tools is good or bad?

* If you solidly fall into the no-code data science camp, how do you view other engineers and scientists who strongly push code-based data science?

I think the data science sector should be continuously pushing back on these companies, please change my mind.

**Edit:** 
Here is a summary so far:

* I intentionally left my post vague of criticisms of no-code DS on purpose to fuel a discussion, [but one user adequately summarized the issues](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/i6hh5u/whats_your_opinion_on_nocode_data_science/g0wnyy4/). To be clear my intention was not to rip on data scientists who use such software, but to find at least some benefits instead of constantly arguing against it. For the trolls, this has nothing to do about job security for python/R/CS/math nerds. I just want to build good systems for the companies I work for while finding some common ground with people who push these tools.

* One takeaway is that no code DS lets data analysts extract value easily and quickly even if they are not the most maintainable solutions. This is desirable because it ""democratizes"" data science, sacrificing some maintainability in favor of value.

* Another takeaway is that a lot of people believe that this is a natural evolution to make DS easy. Similar to how other complex programming languages or tools were abstracted in tech. While I don't completely agree with this in DS, I accept the point.

* Lastly another factor in the decision seems to be that hiring R/Python data scientists is expensive. Such software is desirable to management. 

While the purist side of me wants to continue arguing the above points, I accept them and I just wanted to summarize them for future reference.",0

Please don‚Äôt get deluded, simple projects don‚Äôt demonstrate problem-solving. Everyone is doing them. These projects are simple or stupid or useless copy paste and not at all useful. Be different and build a track record of practical solutions and keep solving more complex projects.

Strive to become a rare combination of skilled, visible, different and valuable

The intersection of all these things with communication & storytelling, creativity, critical and analytical thinking, practical built solutions, model deployment, and other skills do greatly count.",0

446,Data Science Panel: What Makes a Great Data Scientist,211,b8kvew,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/b8kvew/data_science_panel_what_makes_a_great_data/,20,"The first question we had for the panel came courtesy of /u/RyBread7:

**""What are the qualities or traits which differentiate good data scientists from the best data scientists? How, if at all, can these traits be learned or acquired?""**


Panelist Answers:
_______________________________________________________
/u/creampuffcrusader:

The best data scientists I've worked with had these two traits:

**A deeply rooted paranoia about data quality.**

Starting out a project by trying to replicate KPIs and current domain knowledge before jumping into the new and exciting work. Talking to stewards of the data about any quirks they ran into and taking the time to understand the data generating process. This can be learned either from mentor-ship or from experience. For me personally - it was combination of both mentorship and collecting battle scars.

**Holding themselves to the scientific method***

I had a mentor who was a data scientist before it was cool. He started the quantitative supply chain practice at the firm I work in back when the data scientist equivalent position was called Principal Analyst. He had this motto when interviewing stakeholders:

Tribal knowledge is a hypothesis unless there is evidence.
He had this uncanny ability of organizing knowledge by what has been verified, what can be verified, and what is interesting but maybe out of scope or not testable. And using this categorization to efficiently guide us to a quality analysis or product. Really - he was just very strictly holding himself and his team to the scientific method. It was remarkable.

This trait can definitely be learned. But it takes patience and experience.

_______________________________________________________
/u/amadeusmagrabi:

In my experience, the best data scientists are the ones who have **an intrinsic drive to deliver value for the business** and are **able to think outside the box to make sure that the whole team has the highest impact.**

Good data scientists ask their manager what the project requirements are, do their research, deliver a clean and thorough analysis, communicate their most important findings clearly and then ask what they should work on next.

Great data scientists take a more active approach and think about their work with more context. They ask what the larger goal of the project is and challenge the core assumptions. They have ideas for how a project could also benefit other parts of the company or raise awareness for potential conflicts that could occur down the line. They are informed about new frameworks or techniques that come out and suggest innovative ways how they could be used to improve a process. They are genuinely interested in how the business as a whole works and actively talk to people to understand their perspectives. They are full of ideas of what they should work on next. They pride themselves on how many people they helped and not on how complicated the technique they used was.

Importantly, they do all of this because they care about the impact of their work and not because they want the attention or boost their career. They do not start a discussion just for the sake of having a discussion and they are able to step back when their opinions did not resonate with others.

*As to how to acquire these skills:* 

If you do not have a data science job yet, this is hard to prepare. But it helps to read blog posts in which companies from different industries share how they get value out of their data (there are plenty of those on Medium).

Once you have a job, ask as many questions as possible without being too annoying and talk to everyone in the company. Do not be shy and just sit in front of your data. Constantly ask yourself why you are doing what you are doing, if it still makes sense or if there is a better way. Get involved, be curious and let others know about your thoughts. The more feedback you get on your thoughts, the better you can fine-tune your work to the business context.

_______________________________________________________

This depends on the role of the data scientist and the company.

In a tech company where seconds (and milliseconds) matter, then your knowledge of algorithms, statistical learning, and programming matters a lot.

However, if you're in a non-tech company, where data scientists tend to be more ""decision scientists"", and the transactions happen across days or weeks (think buying a car), then the ""soft-skills"" tend to dominate...things like understanding the business, iterating rapidly, and explaining results to non-math/non-engineering executives.

Both are learn-able. However, in my experience the latter (soft skills) are harder to teach.
_______________________________________________________
/u/dfphd:

There are three things that come to mind:

* **They are driven by outcomes and not methods - but can do either well.** 

The best data scientists I've met are the people that are willing to put their ego aside and cobble together a less elegant answer in two days than a more elegant answer in a week because that's what's right for the project. That's not to say that they cannot put together a complex, elegant solution to a problem - when the problem/project calls for it, they can roll their sleeves up and make that happen. But their bias is for getting results, not getting methodologies.

* **They say ""yes"" more often than ""no""**

It's really easy to say no. We can't do that, that can't be done, that won't work, no, no, no. Really good data scientists say yes - knowing that they may need to change the question for it to work, but understanding that they can likely figure something productive out.

* **They build strong relationships based on work credibility**

These people tend to do more than just be good at their job - they seem to always manage to leverage the quality of their work into really strong relationships at work, which in turn helps them be even more effective by having a lot of people who are willing to go to bat for them when needed. I think the first two attributes tend to help in building these relationships, but there is extra effort and time that they dedicate to cultivate these relationships over time.

Learning these skills, in my opinion, is largely driven by introspection, i.e., identifying that your objective should be to become as effective and efficient as possible, and that you may need to modify your behaviors, your habits, your comfort zone in order to become that person. Once you can legitimately convince yourself that these are skills worth developing, the rest becomes an exercise in keeping yourself honest - in constantly call yourself out when you are being a method-diva, when you're being a naysayer, and when you're marginalizing your relationships at work.",0

452,Feeling stuck since one year at data science job. Need career advice.,208,ga23pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ga23pe/feeling_stuck_since_one_year_at_data_science_job/,127,"Pay: 80k. Medium col city YoE: 2.5

**TL;dr: DS job doesn't have ML/modelling work. Underpaid. Imposter syndrome kicking in. Want to switch jobs but afraid that I didn't build good experience to apply to bigger more challenging roles. Feeling stuck. Thinking of switching to swe since my statistics and ML growth hasn't been too good at current role. Need advice. More details below.**

I'm a data scientist, and I've been working on the same application for an year or two. I don't see it changing. Most of my experience has been writing spark code and  dev ops and cloud infra work for an application that we build. There's a bit of prototyping work here and there. And some business case development with upper management. The team is really small. And there are no senior members in the DS team. The only thing that I like about it is that I have positioned myself to become the most experienced person in the team on a product that we work on so i get to have a lot of say in the dev process.

I never go to do any ML or statistical modelling at this job. It was my first job after college, and I have severe imposter syndrome kicking in. So now I don't feel like a data scientist, and I'm becoming disillusioned with the field. My MS in data scientist is going to waste since I'm not using the ML and stats I learned. I am afraid to apply to other data science jobs since I feel that I will not be able to clear a DS interview round when it comes to describing what I've done with stats and ML and deep learning. I can study and practice sure but experience matters a lot, and if I don't have that, the only DS jobs I would be able to land in the future would be title inflated analyst roles.

I might switch to a software engineering role with maybe an ML focus because I fear I didn't build any relevant experience for the type of jobs that I want in DS but I have good experience and love writing python, plus coding in general. And I'm also tired of the lack of strong software dev practices in DS teams. I want to go somewhere where I can build things and code more than I do, with a more engineering focused team. Do you think DS jobs with actually challenging work will be harder to get into since I don't have modelling/ML experience?

My company is willing to start Green Card process, and then I'll be stuck here for a couple of years. At least my gc will process faster since processing dates for my nationality is current. It also makes staying at my current role more attractive since I don't know if newer companies would be willing to file GC straight away.

And then there is coronavirus.

I'm working at a startup whereas the 'Chief' Data Scientist (re: the only person), I was tasked with learning computer vision for a new application we're developing.

My background is in Mathematics, I've used R extensively. I know some Python for a course I completed in College, but I'm not pro. Previously, most of my work involved performing Data Analytics, with some simple modeling.

The company paid for all courses mentioned below and I took roughly 3 months to complete almost all of them (still had most of my full-time tasks to do, so I wasn't dedicated 100% to learning Computer Vision).

**Review** \- This is a very good course. Basic, but well taught and focused well on PyTorch. What I didn't like is that it lacks more advanced content. As such it feels a bit shallow when compared to the other courses. Not bad for beginners though, especially if you're looking to learn PyTorch.

**Pros**:

\- Very well taught

\- Basics covered well, lots of time spent on Neural Nets and CNNs

\- Transfer Learning is well taught

\- Teaches PyTorch very well

**Cons**:

\- Only covers the basics and doesn't go into more advanced territory

\- Lacks cool projects

**Score - 4.2/5**

&#x200B;

[Computer Vision - Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/convolutional-neural-networks/computer-vision-Ob1nR) \- by Andrew Ng

**Review** \- Excellent Course! I didn't know why I didn't do this sooner! Complex concepts are broken down so well by Andrew Ng. However, it sort of jumps into the complex code a bit quick. Lots of courses tend to do this. It feels like a typical college course where you're taught the theory but not the execution.

**Pros**:

\- Very well taught! Perhaps the best explanations of any course here.

\- Covers the key concepts of CNNs, Object Detection very well!

\- Covers mostly all the key CV topics

**Cons**:

\- Not a big picture or big project type course, the code you do is more about understanding the principles rather than doing something impressive.

\- It's not a course that will teach u to do things, rather it's focused on understanding what you're doing.

\- Can be expensive since it's $49/mo but if you finish it within that month or even the 7/day trial it's an excellent value.

**Score - 4.5/5**

You'll be able to do a few fun projects after, but it doesn't teach you principles and how to do a lot of this on your own custom projects. Overall though, it's well presented and taught well.

**Pros**:

\- Good variety of core content

\- His code works (always a plus since libraries and packages get updated frequently)

\- Fun projects

**Cons**:

\- Little core basics as it's more of a cookbook type course. Other courses are like this, but many teach the basics before moving onto a project.

\- Some fluff and overly long videos. A bit inconsistent in what's taught well and what's skimmed.

**Score - 4.2/5**

[Python for Computer Vision with OpenCV and Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/) \-  Created by [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/python-for-computer-vision-with-opencv-and-deep-learning/#instructor-1)

I enjoyed this course quite a bit. It's not a Deep Learning course though, at most he has a basic intro to using Keras, and how to implement CIFAR10 and MNIST, but those things are everywhere. The OpenCV and CV Basics are taught very well! And I like his voice and positivity. He's a good teacher and does it well.

**Pros:**

\- Covers the basics of OpenCV well

\- All code works

\- Has a Deep Learning section for added value

\- The instructor is upbeat and easy to follow

**Cons:**

\- The Deep Learning stuff is basic and pretty much fluff to boost the 'value' of this course. It's very basic and can be found elsewhere for free

\- It doesn't have that many cool projects to do

**Score 4.3/5**

[Deep Learning Computer Vision‚Ñ¢ CNN, OpenCV, YOLO, SSD & GANs](https://www.udemy.com/master-deep-learning-computer-visiontm-cnn-ssd-yolo-gans/?couponCode=REDDIT) \-  Created by [Rajeev Ratan](https://www.udemy.com/master-computer-vision-with-opencv-in-python/#instructor-1)

I loved this course! It was my go-to reference for doing so many things. The content in this course is insane and he provides a full Virtual Machine with everything pre-installed (useful as all code works perfectly!). The explanations are very good. He doesn't always go into detail, but when he does it's taught quite well. The only issue I have is that I can see beginners sometimes being turned off since he rarely explains the code. He's more like ""here's the code that does this, this line this and this function was built to do this"". If you're a beginner it's understandable you'd be confused. However, the code, content, and number of projects were far more than the other courses, probably even put together (except for the PyImage course, but we'll get there). So to me, it's worth it. It covers all the details of Computer Vision rather than just pieces that look cool.

**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content regarding using PaperSpace and deploying your CV model on AWS as an API (quite cool!)

**Pros:**

\- Amazing and detailed content

\- Excellent theoretical explanations

\- Shows you how to get the best performance out of a CNN and built a variety of things

\- Very fun projects!

\- An enthusiastic teacher who you can tell has a passion for CV

\- New content always being added it seems!

**Cons:**

\- Not for absolute beginners, now none of these courses are, but this one goes from easy to relatively hard quickly.

\- Instructor at times talks too fast and skims explanations of code

\- Some of the content is text, not video, so I didn't increase the score, but noted it regardless. Not really a con to be perfectly fair.

**Score 4.6/5**

This is the older course of instructor above and it shows, it's been updated quite a bit, but some of the videos aren't the same as the code he provides. That isn't a deal breaker and he does mention it, but it sometimes does make you wonder if was a mistake or intentional. That said, all code is compatible with OpenCV4 which is awesome. Also, the number of projects makes it quite a nice course to get some good practical OpenCV knowledge. A Virtual Machine is also provided (nice touch!). This course has some excellent OpenCV tutorials, fun projects and there is some added Deep Learning stuff so it's quite cool, not as much fluff and good explanations again.

**UPDATE**: Shortly after I posted the review I noticed Rajeev added some new content such as using Caffee models in OpenCV to colorize black and white images and some other object detection stuff, really cool projects but not explained in too much depth, still cool regardless!

**Pros:**

\- Easy to follow and I feel more of the OpenCV basics were thought

\- All code works and explanations are on point!

\- Bonus Deep Learning stuff

\- Fun Projects

\- Enthusiast Lecturer

**Cons:**

\- Audio bad at some times (not much, maybe like 20 mins appears to have been recorded with his laptop mic vs external mic)

\- The code in the videos is not always the same as the downloadable code he provides

[Deep Learning: Advanced Computer Vision (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-computer-vision/?couponCode=REDDITCV)  \- Created by  [Lazy Programmer Inc.](https://www.udemy.com/user/lazy-programmer/)

**UPDATE**: I went back to this course and realized I might have unfairly slammed it. If you want exactly what's offered (look at the syllabus, it's taught really well). But as a standalone CV course, it's lacking.

I enjoyed this course, it doesn't cover very much but it does some of the basics fairly well. What I liked was that it moved relatively slow and spent a while on some details. It goes into good detail about implementing and building the CNN's he teaches. Overall, good course, just not as much wide content as some of the others but still good at what it does!

**Pros:**

\- Covers a few topics, but covers them well

\- If you like code-along courses this is for you

\- Explains Neural Style Transfers and VGG well

**Cons:**

\- He doesn't step outside a few things, but the things he teaches are taught very well too! So it's not a real con per se

\- Code along courses are good, but tend to waste a lot of time for me. I get why many people like it, but to me, it slows me down (could just be my impatience)

\- It lacks a wide variety of projects

**Score - 4.3/5**

**NOTE**: The lazyprogrammer has a second course that seems quite good on GANs and Variational Autoencoders

[Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python - Practitioner Bundle](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book/) \- Created by [Adrian Rosebrock](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/author/adrian/)

(**NOTE** Adrian provided a 10% Coupon:  **reddit**)

This is the mother load. Absolute perfect and monster of a course! Now it's expensive compared to the others, but this course teaches almost everything you'll need. I wish the ImageNet Bundle was included at this price, but that module is over $600. This course covers all key areas of Deep Learning in Computer Vision. It does not have any OpenCV (well some, but PIL or imultils are used more often). The videos aren't detailed, you're paying for the detailed textbooks, the videos are pretty much overviews of each chapter. So, yes the course material and code is where the value is, and it's excellent in quality!

The code isn't always super easy to follow, but he explains almost every line in the book so it's not a complaint, just stating that this isn't a course that's going to be easily accessible to begineers. Also, like some of the others above, it comes with a Virtual Machine with all packages pre-installed.

**UPDATE**: I initially rated the value of this course as 3.5/5 but I'm bumping it 4.1. Adrian and his community will offer to very good help to your research projects etc. So if you're stuck on need advice, it's valuable. Rajeev and Jose will often offer similar support in their Udemy forums, but Adrian's depth and expertise shines if the problem is particularly hard or grounding breaking.

&#x200B;

**Pros:**

\- Probably the best resources for Practical Deep Learning Computer Vision online

\- Excellent explanations by a very experienced and passionate teacher

\- All code is explained nicely

\- Because of his experience, you know he covers the most relevant and important topics

**Cons:**

\- Not for beginners, obviously, but it should be noted if you're a beginner you will feel overwhelmed going into this course

\- Explanations on video are mostly fluff, he doesn't really teach. It's more of an overview of what's covered in the book (which is the real meat of the course)

\- Expensive!

**Score - 4.5/5**

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION**

&#x200B;

Even though I initially rated Rajeev's Udemy course the highest, it's only because of the insanely cheap price of $10. It's a great course and I keep coming back to it a lot. That said, when it goes up against Adrian's $300. It can't compete with the detail and explanations offered in Adrian's text. And I don't know how I missed Andrew Ng's Coursera's course, but the theory explanations in that course are best out all so far (Rajeev and Adrian do an excellent job too).

&#x200B;

**NOTE**: I got around to reviewing Adrian's other bundles. I have a friend who purchased the ImageNet Bundle and he lent me the printed text (which has been updated since). But I don't have access to the videos. Here's a quick summary of the PyImage 3 Bundles

* STARTER BUNDLE - Very good value and an excellent resource. Covers all the basics in detail but doesn't get into more advanced and cooler areas of computer vision such as Object Detection and advanced CNNs.
* PRACTITIONER BUNDLE - Highly recommend you purchase this instead of the Starter Bundle. It's excellent and covers pretty much everything you'd need to know in Computer Vision Deep Learning
* ImageNet Bundle - It's excellent, but to me not really worth double the price of the Practitioner Bundle. It does have some nice projects and some advanced stuff. I was impressed nevertheless, but in terms of actual theory and knowledge, it's not much new content when compared to Practitioner Bundle.

&#x200B;

In summary, I'll put it like this. For a $10 Udemy course, Rajeev's course will take you from beginner to a working professional. But to be an expert, you'll need Adrian's (of PyImage) course. Andrew Ng's course will ensure you're understanding key concepts right, it's brilliant in breaking down the theory.

&#x200B;

EDIT: We experimented with two things.

1) Added in a predictor that is zero up until COVID happens, then spikes to 1, then decays as the effect of COVID diminishes. This basically forces the model to push all COVID effects into the coefficient for this new predictor.

2) Same thing as (1) but instead of a single predictor, we added many predictors that were Fourier expansions with different modes. Looking at the data we basically saw a sinusoidal pattern, so (1) wasn't capturing all of the signal.",0

I figured I‚Äôd update on how this shook out.

I took some of the advice and talked to the project leader. He said he understood and felt the same way. But he didn‚Äôt say much else, and it sort of went unsaid that, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just how it works‚Äù.  I finished the project. A presentation was scheduled for the first day I was off on a 2-week vacation. When I came back, I notice that all my exhibits that didn‚Äôt support the desired result had been removed. At that point I was sort of over the whole thing. They still didn‚Äôt convince anyone that it was a good idea. People asked about methodology and what was missing, and they had to admit that it didn‚Äôt support the conclusion. It was decided that the desired action wouldn‚Äôt be worth it.

That said, there are a number of managers who still think it will be a good idea. I‚Äôm now the guy who has to explain that, no, your intuition was wrong. Yes, I know we planned for this in the business plan. No, I didn‚Äôt miss anything. The data suggests that implementing the changes are a bad idea, but if you think the analysis is wrong, go ahead and do it anyway.

Some things I‚Äôve learned from all this:

1. Document your methodology and be transparent!! My work was combed over thoroughly by many people who were hoping I‚Äôd done it wrong. I was very detailed and clear in my documentation. I kept a research notebook, commented code, and and made everything reproducible. This helped support my point. Just the fact that I was extra transparent (more than others on my team) gave me a lot more credence.

2. Don‚Äôt be confrontational. Let the data do the talking. I think I ended up looking better than I might have because I didn‚Äôt argue my point. I just put the data out there and it did the talking for me.

3. Know when to walk away. This wasn‚Äôt worth making a big deal about. I resigned myself to do what I had to do to finish the project and move on. But I‚Äôm looking to move on to a new company. I lost a lot of respect for some higher up people. Worse, I think people are rewarded more for political reasons than for adding value. I don‚Äôt want to spend my career playing politics. So I‚Äôm going to find something else. (If anyone is hiring data analysts in the DC area, feel free to PM me.)



Original post:

Using a burner account since a couple work people know my normal username.

I‚Äôve been doing more-or-less data science work for about two years at a very large, very established company. You would know the name if I mentioned it. I do some modeling but, honestly, most people just want graphs and tables of particular things they suspect would lead to something profitable.The requests are often something like, ‚ÄúHey, I think there may be a relationship to XYZ and decreased customer churn. Can you throw together some views for me?‚Äù  The higher up you go, the less people trust fancy models that they can‚Äôt understand. They want a nice scatter plot that makes it obvious. And I get that. You gotta sell an idea somehow.

Anyway, I‚Äôve started working on more high profile projects. One project started about 9 months ago and required getting a large data set from a vendor. This took months. In the meantime, more and more high level people started talking about it. The idea of the project was to show that action X would reduce customer churn. This was pretty much assumed to be true, and the analysis was necessary to figure out how much of action X, when, and how much benefit we could expect.

People got excited about this. SVPs we‚Äôre checking in on the status, anxiously awaiting the benefits. When planning for next year, many tacitly assumes this would bring a boost to overall sales and would help them meet more aggressive targets.

The only problem is they‚Äôre all wrong. We got the data and I‚Äôve been crunching it for a month now. No matter how you model it, graph it, slice or dice it, this relationship they assumed existed doesn‚Äôt. Now the supervisor on the project is freaking out. We spent a lot of time on this and a lot of money on the data. People expect to see at least some kind of result. This morning, I was told that ‚Äúwe have to deliver what they expect, even in a small way. We can‚Äôt just say there‚Äôs nothing here worthwhile.‚Äù

I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm expected to manufacture results that simply aren‚Äôt real. I don‚Äôt feel very comfortable with that. And since this started, I‚Äôve noticed that similar problems are not uncommon. People use analyses based on sparse data and unsound conclusions to make convenient decisions. It seems like an unspoken fact that when someone higher up wants to see something you more or less find a way to show that to them. Doing so will get you noticed and promoted. Fussing about statistical significance and data credibility will just annoy people. If I had to guess I‚Äôd say 25% and maybe up to 50% (depending on the director) of our conclusions lack credibility. None of these decisions hurt people or customers; they really just lose us money. But still.

I already know not finding something in this project will negatively affect me‚Äîwhether it be my performance rating or passed up for promotion. It‚Äôs really stressing me out. I‚Äôve started drinking a lot more and it‚Äôs definitely hurting my health. Anyone deal with anything similar? Advice? Is this common?",0

His final book recommendation  - a book about ""Design Thinking"" is very surprising - he says  


>Being a person who‚Äôs done a lot of data analysis, one thing that I‚Äôve found frustrating is the lack of proper mental model for what is going on when you analyse data. Most universities have a class called ‚Äòdata analysis‚Äô, and typically it presents various useful tools, but rarely discusses what actually happens when you do the analysis itself. *Design Thinking* gives a mental model to describe what happens in this process

&#x200B;

So it got me thinking - in my experience the most challenging and exciting part of working with data is thinking things through, seeing if I'm asking the right question, what we should be looking for, etc. Looking at it that way, that recommendation makes a lot of sense.  


What do you guys think?

470,Interview Rant from Experienced Data Scientist,197,b15rra,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/b15rra/interview_rant_from_experienced_data_scientist/,62,"Incompetent interviewers are so frustrating. Companies really need to do a better job of screening the people they allow to conduct interviews. 

So the situation was that I was in an interview process with big company that has a big AI group. I finished my second phone screen two days ago. The first one went really well. I really liked the person. I answered all of their technical questions and I received an email that they wanted to move forward.

The second guy was pretty weird. He didn't introduce himself, and I had to stop him to ask his name. He then proceeds to ask me about the one non machine learning project on my resume. I start to tell him about it, and he asks 

""Well do you have any ML experience? Because we do a lot of that here.""

Well then maybe you should ask me about the three other ML projects on my resume which you clearly didn't read until you asked me that question. I then started to tell him about one of the ML projects on my resume. He asks a few questions in that annoying way, where interviewers try to poke holes in your work to try to through you off balance. I'm thinking ""Dude I worked on this for a year. I know what I'm talking about."" I answer his questions and he seems satisfied.

He then asks me a few basic ML questions (e.g. explain linear regression and SVMs). I easily answer those. He asks me a coding question, which I also easily answer. Throughout this whole time he's challenging me by asking questions on things that he clearly doesn't understand that well. He tried poking holes in my solutions, usually by saying things that we're just wrong, which led me having correct his understanding of basic things (e.g. What is a random variable). I try my best to do it politely as possible.

He then says that he doesn't have anymore questions and if there's anything I want to ask him. I ask a few basic questions about the company, and we call it a day.

I get feedback today that they're not moving forward because of my lack of knowledge of NLP. Dude didn't even ask me about NLP. If he did he would know I'm pretty freaking knowledgable about it. We ended the interview 15 minutes early, which I don't maybe he could have used to ask me about NLP if it's so important. 

What's really frustrating to me about this is the AI group there is really large and the fact that I had a problem with this interviewer doesn't mean I wouldn't fit. In other situations I would just say ""Well at least I don't have to work with him."" But from talking to the other guy, I think I would have actually fit in really well there, and I just had bad luck by getting this one guy as an interviewer.

About 7 months ago I decided I needed a career change due to a number of reasons.  Working as a Mechanical Engineer was not fulfilling anymore and I started to hear more about Data Science and Machine Learning.  I've always had a passion for performing data analyses but never really considered it more than a responsibility of my various positions.  After looking more into the field of Data Science, I was immediately hooked and wanted to learn everything I could in this field.  

I started with a subscription to Datacamp.com and worked my way through the Data Scientist Track with R path.  In addition, I took some courses on Coursera (Machine Learning with Andrew Ng) and EdX (Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science).  I exposed myself to some Kaggle competitions and went to a few local Data Science meetups.  These were great opportunities to network and speak with other Data Scientists/Analysts to see what they were working on and brush up on skills that would look great on my resume.  Ultimately, I focused on Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn), R, and SQL.  The above courses are great for getting your toes wet and introducing you to the basics.  Also, keep looking at r/datascience and reading of others success stories, they have some great roadmaps!

With my skill-set quickly growing, I began applying to jobs about 3 months ago.  Anyone who's been through the application process before will know that this is a painstakingly slow process so whatever you do, don't give up and keep applying!  I applied anywhere and everywhere that had a position that sounded interesting.  Most importantly, I was applying for positions I thought I could eventually do, not just the ones that I could do now.  All the while, still working on my skills through any free courses I could find.

Up until about 3 weeks ago, I was getting very few responses to my applications with even less interviews.  Although discouraging, I didn't give up.  I have to throw a big thanks to my friends, and most particularly my roommates for keeping me going through this process.  The single biggest change through this process occurred after my roommate suggested I update my resume.  Not just the content, but the format and look too.  I reluctantly took this advice and spent a few hours crafting multiple revisions until I got something that I was happy with the result.

After updating my resume and applying to a few new jobs, my responses skyrocketed, I couldn't believe it (I fully intend to create a time series of this whole process BTW).  I went from next to no interviews to multiple phone calls in a single day and multiple in-person interviews in a week.  Full disclosure, it takes more than a pretty resume to extend the interview process so obviously it helps to understand the content.  

I quickly managed to talk my way into a few interviews and I now landed my first job offer with another two interviews finishing up shortly!  My biggest problem now is deciding what to do if I receive multiple offers but that is definitely a good problem to have.  I would have never thought I would be in this situation but it helps to know that it can happen to anyone so don't give up chasing your passions!

I hope my story can serve as a little bit of inspiration to anyone else out there looking to make a career change, it's never too late!

TL;DR
Bored of my current job, wanted a career change
Took some online courses to learn Python, R, and SQL
Created pretty resume
Applied to every job under the sun
Got a job offer!",0

We started pyforest a couple of months ago and released v1.0.0 now.

pyforest lazy-imports all popular Python Data Science and ML libraries so that they are always there when you need them. Once you use a package, pyforest imports it and even adds the import statement to your first Jupyter cell. If you don't use a library, it won't be imported.

[pyforest in action](https://i.redd.it/zeibtrezypa41.gif)

Link to github: [https://github.com/8080labs/pyforest](https://github.com/8080labs/pyforest)

Install it via

    pip install --upgrade pyforest 
    python -m pyforest install_extensions

Any feedback is appreciated.

Best,Florian

p.s: We received a lot of constructive criticism based on our first pyforest version, mainly focusing on making the auto-imports explicit to the user and thus following the ZoP ""explicit is better than implicit"". We took that criticism seriously and improved pyforest in this regard.",0

an open source, community driven '[tech tree](http://www.saedsayad.com/data_mining_map.htm)' of canonical ML problems, accompanied with lessons and code on how to solve each problem.  The tree begins with 101/hello world level ML problems.  Each problem progressively builds on the concepts of the previous problems, with increasing complexity through a few well-defined learning paths through the tech tree.  Content is kept current/in pace state of the art by community submissions and a committee of qualified curators.

**/tl;dr**

&nbsp;

Background on me:  I'm an engineer who made a feeble jump to 'citizen data science' in 2017.  sum total of my education are the courses at fast.ai, by /u/jeremyhoward .  I'm a programmer, not a math PhD (which is why the fast.ai courses appealed to me).  I also have a background in developing IT curriculum, which is why I am posting this. 

And, I'm *quite sure* that the 'how do you get started in Data Science' question has too many answers out there, and none of them are great.   I'll hack a quote together, stolen from [Paul Lockhart](https://www.maa.org/external_archive/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf) and reworded to be relevant to this problem (**bold** are my edits):

> our present system of **data science** education is precisely this kind of nightmare. In
> fact, if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a **person's** natural
> curiosity and love of pattern-making, I couldn‚Äôt possibly do as good a job as is currently being
> done‚Äî I simply wouldn‚Äôt have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless, soulcrushing
> ideas that constitute contemporary **data science** education.

&nbsp;

**Here's are the problems I see with the current state:**

* Too many (very convincing) answers out there to the 'how to get started' question. (blog posts, moocs, reddit threads, etc).
* The answers are typically incomplete due to the *individual* biases of those answering.
* The answers, (and those recommending them after the fact) begin to become stale vs. state-of-the-art the *moment* they are posted.  (e.g. are we seriously still recommending the 2011 Ng course?)
* Most of the learning path recommendations are too frontloaded w formal math/stats heavy for the people typically asking it. Someone who is considering a bona fide Data Science education will *not* need to ask 'how do I get started in Data Science'.  They need help finding a degree program.  Most people asking this question *really* want to become citizen data scientists (bu they don't know it yet).

&nbsp;

**Here is what I envision:**

* A canonical, open source, community driven project maintained in GitHub.
* The content is designed around a **very specific** framework that enforces some core concepts:
    * **problem based:**  Imagine a 'tech tree' of canonical ML/DL problems that represent the center of gravity of *high value* ML/DL methods and techniques.  Like [this](http://www.saedsayad.com/data_mining_map.htm), with one problem per domain, and maybe only 20-30 problems total in the tech tree at any given time.
    * **continuously updated:** Continuous improvements are submitted by the community, and curated by a small committee of qualified maintainers, who are curating around a well-define set of criteria.  New problems and accompanying lessons are submitted in a standard format (see below) via pull request 
    * **progressive**: crawl, walk run.  Learning paths always start with the 'hello world' ML examples, and have a few progressive learning paths defined that define 2-3 different journeys through that tech tree, where each subsequent problem builds on principles learned in those before it.  Problems increase in difficulty/complexity as the learner progresses through the chosen learning path.
    * **practical**: learners are writing code and solving problems as a first principle, with real data from the first step, and every subsequent step.  Humans learn by playing the whole game.  (Read David Perkins, [Making Learning Whole](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/uk/09/01/education-bat-seven-principles-educators))
    * **inclusive:**  This is not intended to be a replacement or comparable to a formal Data Science degree program.  The truth is, a formal DS education is *simply not* a prerequisite to using computers and code to answer questions about data, and to understanding how those answers are derived.
    * **emphasizes math:**  The goal isn't to 'cirucumvent' a formal math education, it's to sprinkle it in judiciously along the way, instead of making it a prerequisite.  e.g. hello world problems will branch off to teach the actual math behind linear regression.  When SGD s introduced, we will branch off to teach the actual math behind SGD.  Every problem should be accompanied by a new practical math component that is given nearly as much emphasis as the problem solving/coding.
    * **standardized:**  The learning content for a 'problem' has a well defined and consistent standard:  Problem statement, sample data, solution criteria, list of principles introduced, a math concept, etc.  The format of problem/lesson submissions is a Jupyter notebook with a step-by-step walkthrough of the problem and solution.  Bonus points for embedding a YT video walkthrough in the notebooks.


&nbsp;


Thoughts?  Feedback?  Anybody want to help?  I'm qualified to organize and drive this initiative, but I'm not qualified to curate or define the specific problems in the tech tree.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So in the last weeks for various reasons I have been meeting with individuals that identified as data scientists, or that had taken several courses, wether online or in a university, of data science. 

What I realized is that most of this programs do not actually provide the necessary tools for doing a correct statistical analysis. They focus on visual presentation of results and some coding (which don't get me wrong, is quite important), but they do not teach what you actually need to do a good project: statistical theory ( and maybe some maths to understand the insides of the processes, but if all they do is of an applied nature, I think this is more of secondary importance). 

&#x200B;

As a result, I have seen projects which , even if they are very pretty to look at, show a lack of understanding of some basic  ideas of statistics, such as running an OLS regression with no or few controls in a non-experimental setting and claiming to have found a causal relationship between the variables.

 In my case I can tell to an extent what is wrong with the design or methodology of the project, but I wonder, now that data science seems to be all the rage, how many people with similar skills have been hired by bussinesses that do not have people with knowledge of statistics, and as result can't know what is wrong with what they do. I know that this is not always true of course, but I worry that it might be relatively extended

**Background**

I'm a graduate student (not CS or stats) on my last semester, looking for my first full-time position. I was offered a full time DS role at SAP in Palo Alto. My fiance really, really wanted to stay in Chicago. And due to a list of financial reasons, I declined the role. Nonetheless, getting offered the role put some serious wind in my sails.

Well, things are not quite the same in Chicago. Many applications get the automated ""we've moved on to other candidate emails"", other times I make it so the final interview. Nonetheless, several companies far less appealing than SAP have not extended an offer.

**So here's the trend I'm noticing**

In cities like Chicago, the requirements are often ""MS in stats or CS required, PhD in either field heavily preferred."" Yet, in cities like Palo Alto or San Francisco, the explicit requirements are often less stringent, like ""high proficiency with statistics and machine learning accrued through academic of professional experiences."" in fact, this was the language used by SAP.

**My hypothesis**

Companies like SAP, and those more prestigious in the tech world (ie FAANG), *know how to teach the skills they need.* It's okay if you don't have a PhD in CS, they know how to train you. Ultimately, they want to see that you possess *the right mindset to absorb complex material quickly*.

Conversely, I believe most companies in Chicago don't know how data science fits into their organization. They know that they need to spend minimum 80k/yr to staff an entry level role and they can't afford to waste that on the wrong talent. Plus with the population so high and several great universities like (U Chicago and Northwestern) they're able to ask and reasonably expect to catch some PhD level applicants.

Consider this - Google has released ML products like word2vec, BERT, etc. Just in NLP, they're a dominant force. Yet companies that are light years behind from Google seem to think that they'd know how to fully utilize a PhD if they had one. I'd like to laugh, but I'm really just discouraged. My hat's off to self taught DS. You definitely have to prove your worth to lock down a DS role and deserve accolades for doing it.

The analysis however is not only poor (underreporting results, which are just a correlation r value plus a line on a graph), it is exactly the type which makes a lot of people look at quantitative social science and political science as a child's playground.

The paper is based on a classification algorithm, which is so poorly documented, that you can only get any kind of accuracy from one single graph (nothing in the text), which actually shows that almost half of the cases were classified with an error so large, that it could span across three categories. The classification is based on a range, where classes span 5 units of measurement. The error for ~46% of classified data points is at least 5.5, so theoretically this is as ambigous as it gets. The algorithm is only documented in 4 pages, so there is literally nothing to go on. The first paper cites the short paper, and links to a google drive for the source code, but the link throws a 404, despite the paper coming out a week ago.

I have nothing against the author, I have nothing in making them retract the paper. I've been working in data modelling for years now, and linear models are my specialty, so I'm fairly certain I'm right. I'm also active academically, and as a person who tries to legitimize quantitative social sciences, I think papers like this hurt us a great deal.

Is it a dick move if I voice my concerns to the journal?

EDIT: wow this blew up. Thank you for the comments, I will read them until they come. I wrote to the managing editors, phrased a letter, and told them otherwise that I have nothing to gain or lose from this, so it really is their domain to decide. They were very chill about it, and asked for a few weeks time.",0

I work at an F100 company and work mostly in sales analytics (I'm a little more on the business side and I still dont consider myself a data scientist but I'm not that far off).

A few years back one of my teams did some volunteer work - I stood next to phD data scientists at a food bank as we took bananas out of their plastic wrapping and put them back in the boxes (guess they last longer?)

504,"Company culture rarely changes - the reason behind it, and maybe a way to change it",186,dqaiqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/dqaiqq/company_culture_rarely_changes_the_reason_behind/,28,"I've worked several jobs in my life, and one of the things that I have heard discussed, pitched, sold, bought at every one of them was their idea of a company culture.

""We're a company focused on innovation and teamwork"".

""We are a team that is committed to going above and beyond""

Companies, teams and people will self-assign core values and philosophies as easily as they put on clothes, and there is a general feeling that if you say it enough times, that becomes your culture.

But it isn't, and the very definition of company culture - the real definition - is the same reason why company culture rarely changes.

**The real company culture is the set of behaviors that get people hired and promoted\***

It's that simple. If you declare yourself an ""innovative culture"", but you promote the people who are most willing to defend the old way of doing things... you're not. If you declare yourself of being a high performing culture, but the people that work themselves to death get passed for promotions by the people who play politics, then you're just a political culture. If you declare yourself to be a company that believes in family values, but has VPs that demand their employees to work nights and weekends to meet deadlines... you get the point.

Most importantly, because the people that exhibit these behaviors get hired and promoted faster than the people who don't, your organization will always put its future in the hands of the people who live that culture - the real culture. And that means that it will be *incredibly* rare for someone to be in a position of authority that is willing - let alone able - to challenge that culture. And that is because, by definition, what got them there *is* the culture.

*Why are you posting this?*

Because my current role is one of the few I've had where I have felt happy with the culture, and what it made me realize is that at several of my previous stops I subconsciously was waiting for the culture to change. In some cases, it was their viewpoints on work-life balance. At other stops, it was their commitment to data literacy. 

And those things never changed, and even after I have left and looked back several years later, they haven't changed. And this includes organizations that have had changes at the C-Suite level - several of them. 

**If you are not happy with your company's culture today, you need to start looking for a new job yesterday, because you are on a ride that will make you more and more frustrated each day until you explode.**

And you don't need to do that to yourself. There are too many jobs out there, too many companies to subject yourself to a company culture that doesn't jive with you. More importantly, there are 100% companies out there with healthy cultures that can foster a good career for data scientists, regardless of what your personal preferences as far as work-life balance and everything else might be.

*Ok* u/dfphd*, you mentioned something in the title something about changing company culture. How do you do that?*

Note - this only works in a subset of cases: 

1. Live the values the company wants you to live when everyone outside your team is watching (i.e., get all your work done the way the company wants it done when people are looking)
2. In private, conduct yourself (and your team if you have one) according to the values that you think the company should value *and deliver outstanding results while doing so.* 

You have a company that doesn't value innovation, but rather producing the same 1000 reports every day? Well, keep producing the same 1000 reports every day, but then in ninja mode, come up with an alternate solution that does away with the 1000 reports. And then implement it, and make everything better, and have a bunch of people give it glowing support. 

And then do it again and again and again and again until you start infecting people around you and they want to get some of that same positive feedback you're getting.

Caveats:

1. It works a hell of a lot better if you're an executive. Or at least like an upper-middle manager (e.g., Director).
2. It is *exhausting* both for you and anyone who you may manage.
3. If you ever slip up on your primary work, you will get crucified for spending any level of effort on this other stuff, so you need to be flawless.
4. Even if you do everything right, it may not work.

508,Failed a job interview - Was my approach wrong?,191,e2en0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/e2en0j/failed_a_job_interview_was_my_approach_wrong/,112,"So I currently work as a data scientist, and I recently failed a data science job interview at a large professional services firm. 

The feedback from my interview was that I came across very well, but that I failed on the technical test.

The technical test was to do a Powerpoint presentation of how I would deduplicate a dataset of 10 million rows which contains information such as name, address ect where some of the rows are fuzzy duplicates of other rows. There was no limit placed on the type of approach or packages used. The task was presented as a business problem, 'we need to call individuals in the dataset to get consent to keep their data, we don't want to call the same individual more than once. We have an approaching deadline.'

My approach was to preprocess the data,  split it into chunks, deduplicate a chunk, and then systematically compare the deduplicated chunk with other chunks, and iterate the same process through the remaining chunks.

In the feedback from the interview they said the main reason why I failed is that for the within-chunk-deduplication and comparison-with-other-chunks parts of the process I used a [pre-built package](https://recordlinkage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about.html#introduction) rather than building one from scratch myself.

To me, building one myself is a waste of time, as I would just be recreating something that already exists. But obviously they thought I did the wrong thing. 

In case something like this comes up again, I would be interested to hear what others think, did I do wrong by using an existing package? Or did they do wrong by expecting candidates to approach the task and not try to time-optimise the approach?



Edit: One quote from my feedback was: ‚ÄúI thought he failed to demonstrate any ingenuity, instead circumventing the primary problem by using a pre-built package""",0

I've built infrastructure to process TBs of streaming data, apps to analyze and summarize data and built ML models (lots of regressions, clustering, graph theory... DL coming soon) as well as a few publications (science specific jounals, no ICML,  NEURIPS etc).  

Had onsites with 3 FAANG companies in the past year and the recruiters said that I just didn't have enough production experience.  Here's a quick breakdown of the roles and reasons for rejection

&#x200B;

1. SWE-ML: Primarily SWE but implementing ML so must understand it, similar to MLE.  Recruiter said that the interviewer did not consider my experience ""ML"" (signal estimation, sparse graph modeling and disease state estimation aren't DL so maybe that's specifically what he meant?).  I could have done better on the algos too.  Said 50% lack of experience and 50% algo.
2. Data Scientist: Seemed more like an analyst position where you spend most of your time slicing data.  Recruiter said I just straight up didn't have enough product facing experience.   One of the interviewers said I didn't have enough ""Data Science"" skills, which may be true based on how they define a ""Data Scientist"".  I don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out why DAU's are down in some area... although, I spend most of my time combining through noisy data trying to find a link between disease states and sub patient signals which has a lot of data slicing and modeling so... wouldn't this transfer?
3. Data Scientist: Generalist DS position with a heavier software req.  Sort of like an applied scientist.  Recruiter said I just hadn't worked on any public facing products and the other candidates had.  Recommended I go get a few more years xp at tech startup with a product and reach back out.

Every recruiter said I did well on the leadership and culture fit questions and that the interviewers enjoyed talking to me.  I'm sure I could still improve these areas but it seems to not be the reason unless it's just easier to use a catch-all ""well, they lack xp"".  If it really is lack of production level experience and academia has no user product, how should I go about this? Here are my current ideas

&#x200B;

1. Build a web app that showcases ML/DL algos implemented by hand.  Use a flask app to serve the algo and visitors to the site could select an algo and submit an image (i.e., for classification, maybe pick an AI Gym task for RL etc).  I would also have to be able to handle many users at once (or mock them).  This would showcase I can build a product, implement ML/DL (not just take something out of model zoo) and handle serving.
2. Contribute to open source.  This feels mostly like mostly swe.  Maybe there's an early stage ML project that I could add algo's they just haven't gotten to?
3. Take a job at a smaller company for a year? I don't necessarily need to work at a FAANG but I was primarily focused on them as ML is a big part of their products which means there's lots of different types of ML to do and plenty of mentorship.  I'm fine working anywhere that is ML heavy and hopefully pays more than what I currently make.

&#x200B;

Anyone have ideas on how to get this xp? Anyone have a similar transition?

Recently through work I was invited to attend a career day where 20 new bootcamp grads presented their capstone project. I went with the goal of possibly opening up my viewpoint on bootcamps, and here are ultimately my thoughts.

**There are some bootcamp people who have very advanced degrees, and are using it to bridge the gap between academia and industry.**

Out of 20 people, 3 had a M.S. and 2 had a PhD. I definitely noticed a more thorough approach in their capstone projects (i.e. carefully deciding on which models to use, understanding their data, understanding model outputs, and effortlessly conveying to the audience what their results produced.) These were definitely the strongest projects, and with their knowledge in academia plus skills like Python, AWS, etc. taught in the bootcamp will most likely land jobs.

**There seems to be a large disconnect between what Data Science is in a bootcamp and Data Science in real life.**

15/20 projects involved Computer Vision, Audio/Image Processing, or NLP. Nearly everyone used pre-trained deep neural nets, word2vec, etc. and just applied their own datasets (often Kaggle sets) and nonsensically add/removed layers to fine tune their model results. Most of the presentations revolved around if their results were cool or not, and this is a very dangerous approach to DS, as:

* You will most likely not be doing deep learning after your bootcamp. This sets an unrealistic goal.
* Some fed their neural nets completely biased datasets, and it was clear that the results were biased as well and they did not realize this
* It was clear that some people did not understand how they work at all, and were just interested in the results and applications. This leads me to:

**The fundamentals of Machine Learning and Statistics seemed to be ignored**

Nearly all of the bachelors level presentations used extremely clean datasets from Kaggle and were essentially cookie cutter projects based off of each other. There was almost no discussion on understanding feature relationships, feature engineering, feature importance, missing value imputation, bias, etc. (the few that did do it stood out to me very well.) Everyone jumped to the strongest models first (deep neural nets, XGBoost) without trying simpler ones to see if it would solve their question. 

All in all, I can see why bootcamps have their appeal (why do a 2 year MS or a 4-6 year PhD when I can land a job in 12 weeks?) and I do believe that they could land jobs in certain places (such as roles that are glorified analysts, basic data engineering, or the modeling is cookie cutter.) However in an environment where businesses are trying to solve unique and tough problems that highly impacts the business, a bootcamper may fail as they don't have the sound fundamentals as someone who has spent years studying the field of ML.

EDIT: I also asked around, and the rate for people landing ML jobs after bootcamps are about 25%.",0

What I find confusing and frustrating is that each of these interview processes included a programming challenge in SQL and Python, so my skill level wasn‚Äôt exactly a secret-and I still got called in for an in-person interview in each case. I got my masters in statistics with a concentration in data science, so my resume doesn‚Äôt mention a computer science background anywhere ‚Äîneither did the job postings, for that matter.

In each case I asked the recruiter for more details on what they were looking for, since CS is obviously a huge field.  Were they looking for someone with more knowledge about data structures / algorithms?  A programming language that I am unfamiliar with?  I never got a clear answer on what exactly they wanted in a candidate, so I‚Äôm a bit lost.  Should I be pursuing a second master‚Äôs degree, or is it enough to simply improve my python / SQL skills?

It's fun and challenging, but also at times very frustrating, because I have this constant feeling of *never knowing enough,* and given the complexity and depth of this field, and the pace at which it develops, it is really overwhelming.

For those unfamiliar with Project Euler it has many different mathematical problems many of which are unsolvable by brute force with a programming language. It forces you to think about things in the most efficient way possible and find solutions which are not obvious at first. After you solve the problem you can view a forum thread for that specific problem in which other people post their code for their solutions. It's a lot of fun seeing how your algorithm compares to others and learning ways which your algorithm can be improved. 

I was just wondering if something similar to this exists for machine learning specifically? I'm hoping to try out some different machine learning models in a non-competitive relaxed environment and also have ability to see how others solved the same problem. It would also be great if my progress was tracked and there are achievements (Just like Project Euler!).",0

546,Trilogy Bootcamps - A Warning,180,bd7ah3,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bd7ah3/trilogy_bootcamps_a_warning/,90,"TL;DR: Trilogy Education Bootcamps are a scam. If you're considering a bootcamp, and it's partnered with a university, check if it's hosted by Trilogy before enrolling. If it is, stay away.

Hi all,

Just wanted to write a quick cautionary post for anyone considering bootcamps as a potential route for getting into the data science field.

I‚Äôm a recent graduate with an MS in applied math in December looking for positions as a data analyst / scientist. Unfortunately, I wasn't having much luck getting responses. I didn't have any previous internships, as my original plan was to get a PhD, and only ended up getting the MS due to major problems with the school that cropped up halfway through my third semester (a whole other story, though). I had seen a few recommendations for bootcamps on here as a way to break into the field for people with no experience. I noticed that my undergraduate school ""hosted"" one, and figured that it might be a good way to fill in the gap between me graduating and me finally getting a job, and at the very least learn how to implement all of the theory that I had been learning over my degrees. I had some experience in Python from undergrad and from going through some Kaggle tutorials, but figured there had to be something else I was missing since I wasn't getting any responses.

After enrolling and paying (way too much) money, I got to the class and learned pretty quickly that the bootcamp wasn't hosted by the university, but rather some company called Trilogy Education Services. Already I felt uneasy about continuing, but figured since I already paid I should stick with it. As the class continued, however, I quickly realized that I had essentially been swindled.

Enrollment: When I submitted my email / cell number for an ""I'm interested, tell me more"" link, I started to get daily calls from some employee of Trilogy who I thought was working for the university they were partnered with. Looking back, they were definitely trying to bait me into signing up for the class as soon as possible. There was an entrance exam, meant to screen people out, which was an absolute joke and that I wouldn't be surprised if no one actually does get screened. Some of the golden lines were ""we only have one spot left, and there's a few people I'm talking to that are considering it"" and ""I can't tell you which companies we have at the career days, like if I told you it was <massive company with ties to my city> and they weren't there, you'd be disappointed, but if you knew which companies we were partnered with, you'd be excited"" (these exact lines were also told to my classmates, too!). Red flags were going off at this point for me, but I was scared about having a gap on my resume where I wasn't doing anything, so I ended up taking the bait. Once I finally to the class, after paying, I learned that it was Trilogy hosting the class, and not the university.

Curriculum: All over the place. It's obvious that they come from a webdev bootcamp background. So far it's been: 2 weeks of Excel / VBA, 6 weeks of Python (this should be the meat of the course, but everything we covered was so basic that I had already covered it between the single class I had taken and Kaggle tutorials), some relational database stuff (I hadn't even taken a class on this and I knew 90% of the stuff they taught just from spending a week or two on hackerrank SQL questions...), HTML / CSS website building (boiled down to copy and pasting lines of bootstrap code), a few random other topics like nonrelational databases (explained poorly, I still don't know when you'd use a relational vs nonrelational other than when you really want joins), some statistics / hypothesis testing (explained very incorrectly), and web scraping with beautifulsoup / splinter (surprisingly decent, though I knew BS beforehand). Next week we're going into JS, which‚Ä¶ why‚Ä¶ It feels like everything we're learning is solely for visualizing data, when I signed up for the bootcamp (and expressed to the recruiter person) that I was seeking to become a data scientist. We were told that it was a project based curriculum to help better our portfolio, but none of the projects we've done I'd feel comfortable pinning on my GitHub or listing on my resume.

Support staff: The instructor... is a nice guy, but god awful at teaching. Incredibly basic concepts that even I could talk about would be explained in the most convoluted way possible that would leave everyone confused. Every single time a student asks a question, he fails to understand the meat of what they're asking and starts going off on some long tangent talking about stuff that isn't relevant to what they asked. He also is horrible at keeping pace with the class, and we will very often fall behind to the point where some assignments simply aren't covered or are explained during extra hours that he tacks on before class. Additionally, I feel sometimes like he just doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about. I remember a specific time that the person sitting next to me asked him a pretty simple question (which should have been answered in the solutions to the assignment we were doing), and the instructor proceeded to go into a 10 minute tangent trying to figure out what to do, before I finally leaned over and answered her question in a sentence. I remember when we were discussing hypothesis testing that the instructor, in one day, attempted to: accept the null hypothesis, accept the alternative hypothesis, thought that a p-value of 0.5 was the usual threshold of significance (he said this multiple times, even after being corrected), and thought that we had a p-value of ~6.38 on one problem because he didn't understand what the e-05 at the end of the number meant (and seemed to still not get it after another student explained scientific notation to him).

~~The TAs don't do anything. We had one good one who stopped participating after a couple months due to schedule overload, and after he left I don't think a TA has talked to me or asked me how I was doing on the assignments more than one or two times since. Other classmates have the same complaints. Instead, all they do is sit in the back and talk loudly to each other while the instructor is attempting to teach.~~ (see edit: I was being too harsh on them. They're doing their best, and honestly are the best part of the class) 

There's a ""student success manager"" in charge of some behind the scenes of the class that also doesn't seem to do anything. We have weekly reviews that are submitted of how we're feeling about the class, and after I finally submitted 10 or so poor - mediocre reviews she emailed me asking what she can do to help, and after giving a response of my grievances I was met with silence. Career services so far has been useless. All we've done halfway through the class is develop a brand statement (elevator speech) and submitted our resume for review (my comments boiled down to put the bootcamp at the top of the resume and take out any academic achievements I had like my published paper, which... why...) or given information documents with stuff that seems blatantly wrong (We were given a document of skill clusters for different jobs, and I may be wrong here, but I don't think Hadoop is the 3rd most important skill a data scientist should have).

Companies Trilogy is *actually* partnered with: The previous session of the bootcamp that was hosted at the same location had their career day during one of our classes, so I got to see what they had to offer. And... it was maybe 10 or so tiny companies / startups I had seen on linkedin during my job hunt, and nothing from large companies that I'd like to have connections at. <massive company with ties to my city> was definitely *not* there. One of my classmates even talked to one of them and their recruiter told him that they weren't even looking for entry-level people, and were there for senior managers, which is just absolutely hilarious.

Overall, the way I feel can be summed up as: I'm paying money for the company to use me as a partial TA. Half the time I'm in the class I'm helping answer questions of my classmates and explain things to them that I understood but went over their heads. I was told by the recruiter that I'd be a good fit and bring a lot to the class, but I didn't realize it would be in the form of free labor for them.

These grievances aren't just how I'm feeling either. I was thinking that I was the one person feeling this way about the class since I came in with an advanced background and thought ""maybe I was just at a level above what this is targeting,"" but after talking to some of my classmates who came in with no background in these topics (so what this bootcamp is targeting), they all feel the exact same way as me, except instead of feeling like they're wasting their time covering what they already know, they're wasting their time having everything explained to them poorly and then will need to go back and actually learn it on their own. Which, if that's the case for everyone, then why are we paying $10k a seat for an instructor and TAs to not be helpful?

If you're considering a bootcamp that's partnered with a university, and they seem to be partnered with a fair few, please check if the bootcamp is associated or hosted by Trilogy in any way. If it is, I would highly recommend against pursuing it. People in my situation (advanced degree, slight knowledge of what goes on in DS but no experience) would be far better off simply tackling some Kaggle problems and learning this on their own. People with absolutely no knowledge of what happens in DS won't develop proper skills here, unless the only thing you wanted to do was build web dashboards, which you could probably find some online resources covering exactly this for free. After spending a few months applying, I'm finally starting to get some responses for jobs, no thanks to this bootcamp. I'm not even sure if I should be listing it on my resume, to be quite frank, because I feel like the projects I've done on my own and my degree go a lot farther.

Hopefully someone in the same position I was in gets something from this post. Thanks for reading.

__

Edit: Looking back I was too harsh on the TAs. I'm probably fixating on a couple of off days that they had, and during class today I noticed they were going around and answering questions a lot more than I used to notice. We also have a newer one who definitely seems to be doing quite well.

554,New Library - Multiple Imputation by Random Forests in Python,177,iehsf2,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/iehsf2/new_library_multiple_imputation_by_random_forests/,26,"Hi r/datascience,

I'm the maintainer of [miceRanger](https://github.com/farrellday/miceRanger), an R package which performs Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) with random forests. I have developed a package, miceForest, which does the same thing in Python:

* [Github](https://github.com/AnotherSamWilson/miceForest)
* [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/miceForest/)

I'm a huge fan of documentation, so I've included a very comprehensive README on the github, which explains the MICE algorithm and the details of the package.

# What is MICE?

Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE) is an iterative method that allows you to fill in missing data using all of the available information in the dataset. Over a series of iterations, every column in the data set gets modeled by the other columns, and the missing values are inferred by the model. Stef Van Buuren wrote the book on missing data, which details the algorithm [here](https://stefvanbuuren.name/fimd/ch-introduction.html).

Random forests are a good 'chaining equation' to use because they:

1. Do not need much hyperparameter tuning
2. Easily handle non-linear relationships in the data
3. Can return OOB performance inexpensively
4. Are trivially parallelizable
5. Can return feature importance for diagnostics

# What is it used for?

I do a lot of funnel modeling at my current position, and MICE has proven invaluable. It allows us to eliminate bias in the funnel caused by missing data being 'less missing' the further up the funnel you go, which allows us to:

1. Use all available information, no matter the funnel stage
2. Create confidence intervals on our predictions. More data filled out = less imputed variance = a more confident prediction. This allows us to create more robust confidence intervals for our forecasts.

# Motivation?

I originally developed this package for R because all of the available packages were lacking in either speed or features. As I start using Python more, I noticed that the available MICE implementations do not provide the functionality I find myself using most often (custom imputation schemas, built in diagnostic plotting, imputing new data).",0

559,Insight Into Recruiting At Big Tech Company From Former Data Scientist,174,bfgwvt,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bfgwvt/insight_into_recruiting_at_big_tech_company_from/,39,"Context for what follows:  I was a Data Scientist for 4-5 years, and now I work in tech recruiting at a large tech company.  I'm recruiting for software developers specifically, but I'm guessing that my experience is relevant for Data Science as well.

I've seen several threads recently debating the merits/importance of the actual job title ""Data Scientist.""  I've commented something to the effect of: I don't think it's the most important thing in the world, but I also don't think it's meaningless.   
So I'd like to give some insight as to where I think it does and doesn't matter.

In my current role at ""large tech company,"" I source resumes from an internal database based on whatever logic my imagination can come up with.  I might choose to search for ""software developer"" or I might choose to search for ""java OR c++ OR scalability OR service oriented architecture"" - in other words, I can search for job titles if I want, or I can search for key words / skillsets.  The reality is that it's not lost on recruiters that job titles can be highly variable, so more often than not, we're looking for the skillsets / the keywords we expect to represent them.  So that's how we find resumes and get you into the whole coding test, phone screen, etc process.  So the next question is: how does your job title affect salary should you receive an offer?  At my company it flat out doesn't.  The salary ranges are set internally based on the job we're recruiting for.  There's room for negotiation and exceptions and all of that, but that's a conversation that happens so far down the line that the real technical folks already have a good understanding of who you are.  So I can say with confidence that: 1) recruiters know there is variability in job titles, but usually have a more specific idea of what skills they're looking for and adjust their strategies accordingly, and 2) it really doesn't affect your salary if you're hired.  So in the context of a large tech company with recruiters sourcing for candidates, the job title is not that important.  If you don't have the actual job title ""Data Scientist"" then just make sure that you write ""Data Science"" somewhere on your resume just in case.

Now let me tell you where I think the job title might actually matter: at smaller companies that don't have sophisticated recruiting operations.  I've worked at a start up where literally the founder of the company found me on LinkedIn directly. And I can almost guarantee that he found me simply by searching for ""Data Science + <city>.""  Now, it's possible that in those search results he found people with the actual job title ""Data Scientist"" but also people who just have Data Science mentioned in their profile.  It's hard to say what heuristics he used to filter down those results, but I have to imagine this is something that really changes on a case to case basis.  If I'm looking to hire someone, questions I might ask myself are - do I need an experienced Data Scientist? can I just train an aspiring Data Scientist instead?  All of those types of considerations affect what someone looking to hire for a Data Science role is going to do and there are too many possibilities to generalize on the importance or lack thereof of the title.  The answer is definitely maybe!

The last consideration that I'd like to address is how the job title pertains to perceptions of career progression and seniority.  That's definitely something recruiters look for when they're hiring for non entry level positions.  But from my experience so far, I think that if you have the appropriate years of relevant experience, an odd looking career progression might get noticed and asked about later on, but I think it's less likely to be used as a reason to screen you out early in the process.  

I could go an ad nauseam, but I think I'll just end this here.  I hope this helps people at least a little.",0

Over the years I have obsessed about how to make it easy for every one to build their resume. Using some AI magic, I ended up creating a site (a side project) that allows you to create a resume for free. Here‚Äôs the link: [https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/](https://thisresumedoesnotexist.com/)

I've used [https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/tree/master/textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn/tree/master/textgenrnn) to generate the text by feeding it data scraped from various resources. My script runs in a ""while true"" loop and generates a new resume every 3-4 seconds. Resume is then saved to S3 and the same resume is loaded via CloudFront for all users.

I plan to make it more and more awesome, like you add your name and designation and it fills up your resume. But, I thought it would be nice to get a feedback from you folks and see if I can add the to my to-do for the side project.

I‚Äôd the following thoughts on why I started working on it:

\- I knew a guy who got a job at Google, who previously couldn‚Äôt get a job at an IT agency just cause his resume wasn‚Äôt good enough

\- Not all of us have the skills required to write creatively and organize it. That doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt qualify for a job

Things like these are weirdly still a hurdle for many (it is going to be 2020 next year!). I want them not to be a hurdle anymore :slightly\_smiling\_face:

So, pitchfork me if you hate what I built, but if you loved it or have any suggestions do share your thoughts with me. Appreciation will make my day, critique will help me shape it.

562,Why Some Companies Want Their Data Scientists to be Good Engineers,177,f6pnmc,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/f6pnmc/why_some_companies_want_their_data_scientists_to/,53,"There have been several posts lately about the apparently growing trend for data scientist jobs to have engineering requirements. Most of the explanations are some combination of:

* assuming job description does not match actual role
* different job types being lumped into ""data scientist"" title
* assuming companies don't know what they're doing or doing things ""wrong""

Those things are probably happening to some degree. But there some very valid reasons for companies to want people who marry data scientist and engineer skills, which I don't really see being given much coverage in these discussions, so I would like to cover some of them.

Even if you disagree with the reasons, you should be aware that these positions are lucrative, and in my opinion, do interesting work, so it might make sense to understand what these positions are and why they have the requirements they do.

A growing number of companies have products which rely on making recommendations or decisions at scale and rely on ML to make those decisions. It's a critical business need for the systems to be robust. However, experimentation and iteration are key components of data science, so systems must also be adaptable. I hope it's obvious that building a robust, yet adaptable system is a hard engineering challenge.

You might wonder why it is the realm of data scientists and not of data engineers and machine learning engineers to work on such a system. The answer is it is the realm of all three. Data engineers and machine learning engineers will own certain core components and data scientists will own certain modules.

An example might be that the data engineering team owns a system that performs ETL, but a data scientist might implement a transformation to calculate a specific feature or metric that is then run within the ETL system to produce the feature on a regular basis. If the data scientist is owning the actual transform, then she likely takes into account computational complexity when designing the feature, has verified the code produces the expected output, and is not blocked by another team's planning / priorities.

Another example is that as decision making systems evolve, their complexities grow. A simple system might use an ML model and make some decision based on a threshold, i.e. choose a point on the ROC. I'm not sure this case is very common in practice. More complex systems have multiple available actions and rely on the outputs of multiple models. Evolutions of these systems might come from increasing the size of the action space or increasing the number of different models in use. It is usually data scientists who are proposing, designing, and testing these evolutions. Designs to be cognizant of engineering challenges - it is very wasteful to design and build something that cannot be used in practice. On the other hand, it is very difficult for engineers to build something they do not understand.

Even something as simple as training a model cannot be divorced from engineering realities. Large scale systems have latency and memory constraints. The freedom that is present during model explorations to include new features or try new model architecture is generally at odds with these constraints. New ideas that cannot be implemented in the production system are wasted, so data scientists have to have a strong understanding of how those constraints affect their models.

So if I were to try to list the key arguments I would probably go with:

* Coordination costs between teams are very high, so enabling data scientists to put their work directly into production makes iteration a lot faster
* Incorporating an understanding of production constraints into the design of new ideas means that execution will be much smoother
* Keeping context of the details of the production system allows the data scientist to make more accurate assessments of what changes will have the highest impact

Which data science paradigm is right for a given company clearly depends on a number of factors, including company size, the extent to which ML is critical to the business, variety of ML products within the company, etc. My impression is that, at least in the tech industry, the data scientist with engineering expertise paradigm is taking hold across a pretty large range of company sizes, with only the very large and very small sticking with the data scientists who are doing very little engineering work.",0

Hey, I'm halfway through the writing of my new book, so I wanted to share that fact and also invite volunteers to help me with the quality. Similarly to [my previous book](http://themlbook.com/), the new book will be distributed on the ""read first, buy later"" principle, when the entire text will remain available online and ""to buy or not to buy"" will be left on the reader's discretion. Thanks to the help of volunteers, my previous book was greatly improved, so I hope for the same for my new book.

The Machine Learning Engineering book will not contain descriptions of any machine learning algorithm or model. It will be entirely devoted to the engineering aspects of implementing a machine learning project, from data collection to model deployment and monitoring. Five chapters are already online and available from the book's [companion website](http://www.mlebook.com/).

I hope to get a ton of feedback from this community. If something is not entirely correct or plain wrong, please don't hesitate to tell me. The best way to leave comments in a specific chapter is by using dropbox's built-in document commenting feature. (Each chapter is a PDF shared on dropbox.)

I understand that there are a multitude of posts regarding how to break into Data Science (DS) without a CS degree or PhD; however, I haven't seen one discussing what non-CS, non-PhD Data Scientist do once they're one in terms of career prospects. I hope this post will allow those type of people to share their experiences.

I‚Äôm a new age Product/Analytics Data Scientist (mix of Business Intelligence using SQL/Python/Tableau and using ML for impact analysis, but limited data engineering and no production-level ML). Having worked for several months, I have become keenly aware of several things about myself:

1. I lack the CS background required to become a Data Engineer (setting up data lakes from scratch; ETL automation; deploying a ML model to production);
2. I lack the PhD background and also do not enjoy the high-level mathematics that will be required to become a ML Engineer (building and optimising cutting-edge algorithms);
3. I lack the economics/finance background to become an DS Economist (focusing on econometrics).

In short, due to my background, I feel like I‚Äôm a half-baked DS who can only remain as a Product/Analyst DS, unless I put a ludicrous amount of time and effort to overcome my (MSc in structural engineering) background and specialise. Similarly, it‚Äôll be very difficult for me to become a non-specialised ‚Äúfull-stack‚Äù DS which is highly sought in small-midscale startups. I‚Äôve also been told that DS Managers who lack technical/specialised expertise are unable to climb far in the management career ladder (say Head of Data), which means just remaining in my current position will likely be a bad move in the long term.

For those that were in a similar situation, what did you end up doing and how did it work out? Did you grit your teeth and specialise, or did you end up switching careers? Please share your experiences!",0

&#x200B;

2017 June. I'm a software engineer with about 5 years experience, a publication in data vis, and a physics/math bachelors who spends a lot of time reading books and studying math, physics, and computer science. I pretty much self taught myself enough programming to make a great income, but spent a lot of time thinking I might be interested in a research role at a company not necessarily working on product and being a slave to release cycles. In my self teaching, I've pretty much went through SICP, Cormen, an Automata Book, ISL, Casella and Berger, and even an analysis of algorithms using combinatorics. I'm not a big fan of R so I learn enough python to get by, but don't deep dive because I already have a healthy full-stack dev job in javascript land where I get paid a ton making web apps that are just wrappers for prediction algorithms. Yet every interview no one would take me seriously in interviews to jump onto a team because of ""lack of experience in the field"". Completely open-ended and ambiguous questions using technologies I don't use in my day to day would hang me up every time. SQL optimization? Some obscure function closure in R? I'd get asked it and drop the ball on an interview. By the way, I also get vetted by software engineers and marketing teams. ""You don't know Google AdWords?"" Mind you these interviews are offering almost $20K less than what I make now, because I don't fall into the ""experienced"" category of job applicants and I'm ""entry level"". So I get an idea, since I'm reading all this stuff and I feel like I know enough to get by:

&#x200B;

Let's do a data science masters!

&#x200B;

My experience is as follows:

&#x200B;

A pre-requisite class introductory programming in Java because as a physics/math major with 5 years of experience, granted in javascript, cannot possibly learn how to program. It's super fun to spend $4k to learn a type system in Java that I already know since I've used Haskell. Lovely.

&#x200B;

Second class, masters level algorithms class which is the first actual class in the program Useful, but we're just going over Cormen et. al. Which I already read. Another $4K down the drain. By the way, my employer isn't paying for this so this is my cash. Granted there was some stuff I glanced over in the first reading like bipartite graph algorithms and getting an idea of max flow, but the rest of the class was cut and dry simple. Mind you I'm paying $4k to fill a hole in my knowledge that could be filled with a Medium post.

&#x200B;

Third Class, masters level statistics class. Useful, but we're just going over the stuff in Casella and Berger. A useful but expensive rehash of all the flavors of distributions and hypothesis testing for all of them. Another $4k down the drain.

&#x200B;

I'm done. My next class would be a review of ISL. Do I need another expensive hand-holding through a book I already read? Shall we discuss confusion matrices and how to construct trees for another $4k? I'm just not doing it. The other set of classes are in databases and optimization. I can read that stuff on my own. There would have been a total of 10 classes at $4K each, so I'm just not setting myself back $40K to apply to jobs that I'll be underqualified for anyways.

&#x200B;

What I've learned:

&#x200B;

Since then I got a job at a business that focuses on being a tool for data scientists so we have then on-staff as well as sell directly to data science teams, where I do full-stack engineering building the product as a software engineer who knows enough stats + data science to build the product. I'm learning that right now data scientist jobs are gatekept, and rightly so, by people who are spending a lot of money on people who are arguably not generating anything on their bottom lines. These stakeholders were already sold on the data-lake ROI that returned nothing, so they're extremely hesitant to invest more in resources in a tech buzz that probably won't actually give them ROI. Keep in mind many of these business don't have any existing resources to get make data scientists productive. It's not alien for data scientists to be hired and they just get pointed to a PostGRES database on AWS, and told ""Here you go."" The standards for getting hired are extremely high in many positions because they simply can't afford a false-positive hire. Keep in mind they don't know what they want anyways, as evidenced by plenty of stories of data scientists who did get jobs but quickly realized they're a one-man show of smoke and mirrors. Companies want to integrate data science into their strategy to remain competitive, but they have no idea what that means for their business. I've learned no to join this rat race. There are plenty of problems for smart people to work on, and data science doesn't need me. 90% of people are using the technologies to detect smiles, and the other 5% credit loan processing, and 5% marketing. I want to do none of these things. I specifically wanted to join a field where I could use more of my mathematics in my day to day, but I'm not willing to sacrifice more cash and an already well founded career for that. As an experienced software developer I make more than an entry level data scientist, whatever that even means since you need a graduate degree to really get your resume looked at. By the way, even with a graduate degree, you better have industry experience or else you'll get bounced by a marketing or finance person in your data science interview, or worse: low-balled.

&#x200B;

In alignment with the bottom up approach I found these resources :

1. [https://mml-book.github.io/](https://mml-book.github.io/)  : This book is still not fully written, but the reddit post under which I found this book had only and literally only positive things to say about it.  Looks very very Math heavy to me though :( 
2. [https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110) : **Stat 110 MOOC by Harvard** along with the book Introduction to Probability by Joe Blitzstein.  which is to be read hand to hand along with the MOOC.

&#x200B;

If you have come so far in the post, thanks a lot for reading, any recommendation regarding the approach(top-down or bottom-up), resource(book,MOOC) anything if you can share I will be glad to hear.

My biggest fear is I also don't have any background in Linear Algebra and Calculus, and at quite a few places I read I should first get the Linear Algebra and Calculus basics cleared before diving into Stats.

Please let me know if you have anything to say regarding which resource among the above mentioned ones I should go for, or any other resource that you think can help me!

631,How to get an internship in 2019,156,b41egp,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/b41egp/how_to_get_an_internship_in_2019/,38,"So you want a coveted internship? This answer is mainly geared towards software, but can be applicable to any industry.

I have some tips that helped me get my first software engineering internship in Silicon Valley, right out of my coding bootcamp. I break down some of the best ways to get an internship as quickly as possible, as easily as possible.

Whether you studied computer science in college, went to a coding bootcamp, or are self-taught, these tips will help you through.

If you prefer video format, here‚Äôs a video I made covering these topics:

[https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng](https://youtu.be/eyzKYYwB0ng)

The first main tip is to start as early as possible. Bigger companies who have the most internships available start early in August, September, an October with posting their internships. The earlier you start, the higher chance you have at beating the competition.

The second tip, and probably the most crucial one is to use your network. Using the back door to get your foot in is much easier than using the door that thousands of people are using (the automated online job portal). You can use LinkedIn, Facebook, and word of mouth to find people who worked at specific companies. On LinkedIn, you can use search queries like \[Insert college here\], and then use people filters such as 1st /2nd-degree connection, location, and company. This helps hyper-target your audience.

The best people in your network to reach out to are:

\- College / coding bootcamp alumni who work at the company you want to work at

\- Friends / classmates who interned at that company

\- Professors / mentors who might have connections with that company

\- Friends of friends who work there (use Facebook to search this - ‚Äúfriends of friends who worked at \[X company\]

The next tip (this is crucial, and will save you a ton of time). Don‚Äôt send your resume off into a black hole (such as Indeed, Glassdoor, etc) and do nothing else. My rule is for every job app you send into an online portal, you need to connect with one real person as well. There are a handful of ways to connect with a real person at this company - use a Gmail plugin like Clearbit Connect, or Hunter io to find peoples‚Äô work emails by company search (give them a quick Google - you‚Äôll see what I mean). These are extremely powerful tools. Then, send them a quick note:

\~\~\~

Hi \[person‚Äôs name\]!

My name is \[your name\], and I‚Äôm an \[type of engineer\] in \[location\].

I‚Äôm reaching out because I applied to \[company\] regarding your \[position\].

I have experience with \[this technology, skill, etc\]

Following up, I've provided my resume and cover attached letter below.

Would someone on your team be open to chatting more about this role by \[insert date to add time pressure\]?

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\[Phone number\]

\~\~\~

Following up after they‚Äôve responded:

Would you be willing to connect me to the hiring manager for this position per chance? I'd greatly appreciate it!

Thanks so much!

\[Your name\]

\~\~\~

The most important thing is to not be annoying. If they don‚Äôt respond after following up once or twice, try another person at the company.

If you‚Äôve used the last 2 tips (network, reaching out) and have finally connected with a real person, you can ask them ‚ÄúHow can I stand out in the intern application process for \[X\] company?‚Äù, or even better, ask to buy them a coffee and pick their brain about their experience working at the company, the company culture, and to see if you‚Äôd be a good fit.

Another way to stand out is to have an amazing portfolio. This isn‚Äôt absolutely necessary (at least for Software Engineers), but will help you stand out above the crowd. My tips here:

\- Host your projects on Github (clean up code, add ReadMe, etc)

\- Add your projects, with screenshots and descriptions, to your LinkedIn experience/projects section

\- Create a video outlining your design decisions, tech choices, etc (I did this when applying, and it definitely helped)

\- Deploy your projects to the web, and have a landing page which can direct people towards them

The next tip is to prepare for the technical interview. If you‚Äôve gotten this far but fail the technical portion, chances are you won‚Äôt make it further. They can give you any question, but your goal is to be familiar enough with basic concepts, so you can adapt on the spot. Using sites like LeetCode can help improve your technical ability. It also helps if you‚Äôve seen similar questions to the interview ones - LeetCode will help you with this. Sites like Pramp help you practice interview skills live, which is another surefire way to get feedback and improve your chances at doing well. Take a few deep breaths before you walk into the interview, and you‚Äôre ready to go because you know you prepared!

The final tip I have (and one that sped up my job search tenfold) is to track EVERYTHING. There‚Äôs a Gmail plugin called streak that allows you to track your job search in a funnel. Streak also allows to send template snippet emails, and you can see if someone has viewed your email. So handy!

I customized the funnel by tracking:

1. Company Name
2. Position Name
3. Contact Name
4. Contact Email
5. Contact LinkedIn
6. Date of Last Contact
7. Job Source
8. Job Posting URL

If you‚Äôre not a fan of Gmail plugins, you can also use a spreadsheet like Excel, Google Sheets, and my favorite (spreadsheet/database mix) Airtable! Airtable is a solid option, because it allows you to link different tables, attach documents, and organize things with ease. An Airtable tutorial would take a whole other post, but I encourage you to check it out!

The job search is ultimately a game of failure, persistence, and triumph. You ultimately need to create your own luck, and this happens by widening your pool. Start applying to as many places as possible! These tips I shared above allowed me to apply to 150 jobs in 3 days! Most of the time I ignored the cover letter (do they really matter, anyway?) and focused completely on connecting with a real person. That‚Äôs what will ultimately start you on your journey.",0

Two years ago, I shared my experience on doing data science in the industry. The writing was originally meant to be a private reflection for myself to celebrate my two year twitterversary at Twitter, but I instead published it on Medium because I believe it could be very useful for many aspiring data scientists.

Fast forward to 2017, I have been working at Airbnb for a little bit less than two years and have recently become a senior data scientist ‚Äî an industry title used to signal that someone has acquired enough technical skills to lead projects. As I reflect on my journey so far and imagine what‚Äôs next to come, I once again wrote down a few lessons that I wish I had known in the early days of my career.

If the intended audience of my previous post was for aspiring data scientists and people who are completely new to the field, then this article is for people who are already in the field but are just starting out. My goal is to not only use this post as a reminder to myself about the important things that I have learned, but also to inspire others as they embark onto their DS careers!

637,I feel like I've plateaued and don't know where to go from here.,156,j18v8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/j18v8w/i_feel_like_ive_plateaued_and_dont_know_where_to/,59,"I'm on the job hunt atm (B.Sc. in CompSci, M.Sc. in DS if you need to know) and I've been working on some simpler projects on the side to not get rusty.

And yet, I feel like I've hit a brick wall? Apart from more advanced stuff, the classification and regression problems I'm doing (data from the UCI repo) seem to follow a simple pattern which I feel like is too easy and surface-level.  

Here's a rough outline of what I usually do:

##### **EDA & Data Cleansing**

* research the problem (what is it about, what is the data representing, what's the objective)

* visualise the data to get a feel (scatterplots, histograms etc.)

* look at value counts, column names to spot simple errors like spelling mistakes

* based on those insights, do some preliminary data cleansing (outlier removal with z-score/IQRs, imputation, dealing with NaNs, applying regex, change/correct data types)

* normalise and/or standardise continuous features and one-hot-encode discrete ones

* check collinearity (mainly with heatmaps)

* generate new features when possible

* form some hypotheses 

##### **Modelling**

* train/test/val split

* try out a bunch of algorithms and then choose the best one

* grid search and k-fold/stratified cross validitation 

* do model-specific steps when needed (e.g. stepwise regression, kernel trick)

##### **Evaluation**

* visualise when possible (e.g. line of best fit, ROC, confusion matrix)

* look at scores and go back to do EDA; repeat until happy

And it works somewhat well, but it does seem rather pedestrian imo, since a lot of it is just trying out different things and seeing what works without any structure. For instance model selection: I usually just run a prepared script with a few of the common algorithms for the given problem and then see what works best.
So I'm wondering - is this it? What do you do? Is this just imposter syndrome speaking? Or rather my lack of commercial experience? And how can I make up for it?",0

646,Has anyone transitioned to software engineering from data science?,151,dpyr2l,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/dpyr2l/has_anyone_transitioned_to_software_engineering/,47,"How'd you do it?


I'm toying with the idea for a few of reasons:


1. The ""data science"" at my company devolved into more analytics than anything else. I've had to continue take courses outside of work to keep the actual data science skills fresh (stats, machine learning, deep learning) but barely get to apply them and it's a real bummer. At this point, I'm sure it'll be pretty hard to get into a ""real"" data science job if I try to transition. Though it seems that data science roles are becoming more product/marketing analytics which isn't too exciting, and I don't think I'm smart enough for the hardcore phd-level research scientist roles


2. I've had a lot of exposure to the data engineering side. ETLs, AWS infra, version control, various APIs, unit testing, pushing things to production, etc. and I find the process of building something from scratch and collaborating with the data engineers really fun


3. I want to be more on the back end and middle of the data spectrum. Pure modeling and analytics is the front-end, and I feel that only very mature companies have the infrastructure set up correctly for data science to be able to unlock its true potential. More job opportunities in the back end/middle for startup and growth stage companies, which i've been liking so far


4. As far as skill combinations go, software engineer + data guy seems like a pretty deadly combo for future success


What's the best process to go about this? I'd consider myself decent at leetcode-easy problems and have a very basic understanding of cs fundamentals. Not sure if I should focus on leetcode, or building a complete application to showcase, or pick up another language (I'm 99% python, 1% Scala and JavaScript), or just edit my resume to highlight the engineering side of things and pray n' spray?


I have a good relationship with the tech side in the company so I can explore possibilities there, but also would like to set myself up with a good foundation to transition to swe in 3-6 months so any guidance would be greatly appreciated!",0

Now, the boundary condition would be the betting odds offerred but to know the rest of the features, you would need to have a knowledge bank of players, teams, stadiums, time of the year, etc. But, what if I wont have/am not interested to know? Hence, the boundary condition is just the team names and betting odds. Now, the training dataset has all the above required information. It has the team names (Cleaning this dataset was super hard but I got there, the scores (We also have other minute details like throws, half time scores, yellow cards, etc. but for now, we are concentrating on full time scores and the odds. I would expect the random tree (even if its averages, its not a bad place to start; I mean, if the classifier would predict 4 actual scores (Winning 1:17, 1:9.5, 1:21, 1:7.5 then, thats break-even for that class of bets for the season already!) to work pretty fine in this scenario. The way I would actually go about is to have h2h score and last 3 matches winning momentum but, I dont know how))

The bets we/I usually place are winningteam/draw and over 1.5 goals or under 3.5 goals. Within this boundary, the predictions fall nicely. Lets see how much I get right this week's EPL. I have placed a few I should know soon.

Though, I admit I suck at coding and at 35 years, I am just rolling with it. If i get stuck at a place, I take a long time to get out lol.

Now, I want to encourage everyone who wants to be a data scientist to work hard at it, but I do worry that some people have romanticised expectations of what the role may involve, & unrealistic understanding of the combination of educational attainment, variety of skills, & practical experience that many data science roles require.

650,Am I too slow or the expectations my manager has are unrealistic?,152,d0izh7,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/d0izh7/am_i_too_slow_or_the_expectations_my_manager_has/,56,"I work at a marketing firm as a data analyst who sometimes does machine learning. Very hesitantly I call myself a data scientist, for the lack of a better word. That term is used very loosely these days. Anyways.

The work is typically like doing some EDA, running simulations for loyalty programs, doing some regression analysis, sometimes doing segmentation on customers using basic SQL/Pandas queries (occasionally using ML techniques), coming up with algorithms for lead scoring, etc.

I have to constantly switch between requirements, tasks are assigned verbally or over email, there's no tracking system in place.

The people I have to deal with don't seem to appreciate that it takes time and effort to write code, generate insights, verify the results, present them in a format that non-tech sales people will understand. Besides, as in any analytics/ML project, the first approach we try seldom works. Data science is as much an iterative process as software development is IMHO. Not to mention that data is never available in a clean format. I have to spend a lot of time cleaning it before I can use it for producing results.

Usually, I get a problem statement at time t, and at t+24 hours, I'm asked for results. I find this difficult to cope with. I come from a software engineering background, where I was used to working on one problem at a time. Nobody expects daily deliverables in a software dev job (at least at no good company again IMHO). Because quality work takes time. There are times when you just don't hit your zone and get stuck at seemingly trivial problems. You need breaks, you need time to relax.

My company doesn't seem to understand this. They are mostly sales/business people who just expect ""decks"" (powerpoint presentations). They have no idea what kind of effort goes into real data science projects.

I have tried to discuss this with my manager that the deadlines are too near and too frequent. Data analytics is not a one day job. But he thinks I have a very pessimistic attitude. I was aghast after hearing that from him.

Am I just too slow for my job? I'm seriously contemplating switching to a new company. I'd like to know what kind of deadlines you guys have at work.",0

I've noticed there are several types of projects:

* once off data analysis
* exploration that leads to a feature shipped in a product
* explorations that never get shipped
* data analysis for debugging purposes. Let's say we run an A/B test and want to figure out whether we set it up correctly. We won't really share results outside of the team.

I guess different project will possibly get different answers, but let's kick off with these questions:

* where do you store the sidecar data? We store the code on GitHub, but don't want to package the data with the code (security/compliance reasons)
* do you make all your explorations reproducible? For example, a piece of code calls the warehouse. Do you store the snapshot of the data somewhere so you know exactly what was analysed?
* do you store all analysis you perform? For example, exec asks you for some numbers for a PPT
* do you keep track of different experiments? What do you use for that? Notion/Confluence/Gdocs/something ML specific?

685,Work repeatedly lied to me about ability to transition and now I'm stuck in a role I hate with a bad economy,144,gb41m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/gb41m8/work_repeatedly_lied_to_me_about_ability_to/,48,"Hello everyone,

So a bit of backstory. I started in my current role roughly nine months ago. During the interview process I made it extremely clear I wanted a data science position (particularly one that involved a lot of machine learning) but the recruiter said there were no openings on data science. She and the others I talked with did say my role would primarily revolve around deploying models into production and not building pipelines and I could transition to data science once there became openings. I did have another full-time data science offer, however it was in a different city. Therefore, I was faced with a tough decision and based both on location and their 'promises' I chose my current role. 

However, in the first few months after starting I realized three things: (1) I wouldn't be deploying any models to production as the DS team had absolutely no models past the prototyping stage (and nine months later they still don't), (2) several others were brought onto the DS team right around when I started, (3) several of the people on DS including the DS lead seemed extremely weak in terms of actual machine learning knowledge. In retrospect this should have been a red-flag but I still hoped I could move off of data engineering and get into data science going. (Also, several of my previous roles had been on contracts, so I wanted to hold down a position for at least a year and not look like a job hopper.)

 Throughout Nov/Dec I tried unsuccessfully to get put on data science projects. This was particularly frustrating as I have expertise in several areas of modeling where the company is struggling. 

Moreover, they transferred several engineers with absolutely no DS background onto DS just because they apparently had nothing better to do with them. However, they kept promising my time would come. Finally, in Feb/Mar they brought me on to a couple of projects aimed at the knowledge graph, apparently because I was the only one in the entire organization with NLP experience. I was happy to work on that but they made it clear that my primary responsibilities for the time being were still data engineering. I asked them if they had plans to hire someone full time to data engineering so I could move over and they said yes. 

Now to the present. They tell me to stop all data science work because they want me 100% focused on data engineering. They come up with some flimsy excuse about the economy and DE needing to be my focus. They also make some references to needing to improve my data engineering performance. (My performance review was perfectly fine. Plus I made it clear to them when I was interviewing DE/ETL was not my strong suit.) Moreover, they still apparently have the resources to hire a full-time data scientist (WTF? they couldn't have hired another data engineer and transitioned me).The data science manager (who still hasn't produced one concrete ML deliverable) literally sits as the product owner of data engineering. At any point he could have prioritized hiring another data engineer so I could move over. I'm beyond frustrated that they have lied to me since day one. However, now the economy is bad and I can't quit outright. I have had  a couple interviews, but I have a number of thing working against me (bad economy, data engineering job title, short current job stay).",0

Data is the closest thing we have to a real world application of truth, and the world is a better place when decisions are made with care. 

Now that you know why you should become a data scientist, here is a simple guide to becoming one. 

**Prerequisites:**

**Math**: You can honestly get really far with little math. That being said, there are far too many people who don't understand the math and end up using analysis techniques with little forethought into why they should be using that model. I will say this much: The more math, the better off you are. It is a beautiful field and directly relevant to you if you want to make the most of your foray into data science. 

Beginner: High school algebra, maybe some calculus 1, high school statistics

Intermediate: College stats, Calc 1,2,3, Probability Theory, linear algebra, Statistical Inference

Advanced: Upper undergrad / Grad level statistical inference, bayesian inference, harder probability theory, linear optimization, convex optimization, real analysis, calculus of variations. Math is the limiting factor, remove those obstacles. Learn all the advanced math you can muster.

Reccs: khanacademy if you've never seen the content. MIT OCW has really great self paced math courses for calc 1-3, linear algebra and much more. Eventually you will want to learn the art of grinding through math textbooks while doing problems. **The only way to learn math is by doing math. Practice, practice, practice.**

If you want to be a true OG, here is Michael I. Jordan's reading list for prospective grad students in ML: 

[Mike I. Jordan ML Books](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1055389)

**Programming**

Pick up a language and stick with it for now. It is far easier to pick up a second language once you are very good at one than it is to slowly work through being mediocre at a bunch of languages. 

People live and die by their language of choice for some reason. Generally, my thoughts on this are the following:

R is fantastic. R is great for data analysis, and if you use the tidyverse, R is great for everything else too. R is an **organically grown** language that is not always lexically consistent, so it can be a bit quirky. Due to the community of statistics researchers that use R, generally you will find the most bleeding edge packages on R. R will make you think like a statistician.

Python is great for taking your data a bit farther. It has packages which provide most of the functionality you would need from R. Python is a great choice because it has many more varied packages and capabilities related to software development. Python is a broad, general purpose language that is beautifully **designed** and consistent. This will make you think more like a programmer.

Over a career, it is wise to know as many tools well as you can. Since you will spend a good amount of time writing code, you should strive to learn both at some point. 

Alrighty, now onto the core stuff. 

**How to:**

**1. Get Data**

This can be done by scraping, downloading a data set, building a data set, making a survey, whatever. There is a lot of data floating around and there are plenty of resources for learning how to scrape. Since data is usually stored in data bases in the real world, it is wise to learn a bit about data bases. Learn some SQL. Since we live in the age of big data, it would also be wise to learn non-relational database query languages like nosql and postgresql

Some good spots for data: /r/datasets, kaggle, data.gov

**2. Clean it**

Remember: garbage in, garbage out. The quality of the data is the foundation of all your work from here on out. Check out a book or a course that will take you from these early stages into actually playing with the data. For python, [Harvard CS109](https://github.com/cs109/content) does this. It also have video lectures. For R, Hadley Wickham (Chief Scientist at RStudio) has a bunch of amazing books out. Check out [R for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Data-Science-Transform-Visualize-Model/dp/1491910399/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1511408512&sr=8-1&keywords=r+for+data+science) . It wouldn't hurt to eventually read a book on data cleaning and data interpolation.

**3. Take some time to familiarize yourself with your data**

What kind of variables are there? Quantitative (numbers)? Categorical / Qualitative (Labels)? Text? Images?
 Geographical? The types of data present will determine what can be modeled. 

Its a good idea to look at the data in list form and plot it out using R or python or excel or whatever. If using other types of data (eg images, geographical), then find the best ways to visualize the data. Now would be a good time to learn about knitr and rmarkdown if using R and jupyter notebooks if using python. 

This is the time to do some *descriptive statistics.* Look at the way the data flows on the plots. What relationships do you think are there? Are there any outliers? Plot, plot, plot, and plot some more. Make the plots look good. Check out ggplot2 in R or matplotlib / seaborn in python. 

Learn to dissect your data. Check out feature engineering. Learn to combine data sets to expand what can be done.

If you want to be a true OG, learn some graphic design principles. Learn to use blank space and color. There is nothing more influential than a beautiful graph. 

Reccs: 

Language Agnostic: [The Visual Display of Quantitative Information](https://www.amazon.com/Visual-Display-Quantitative-Information/dp/0961392142/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1511409465&sr=1-1&keywords=tufte+visual+display)

[GGplot2 book](https://www.amazon.com/ggplot2-Elegant-Graphics-Data-Analysis/dp/331924275X/ref=pd_sim_14_7?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=V86PEMXGW96XK2JF2AHX)

A book on seaborn / matplotlib if using python. 

**4. Figure out the questions you want to ask**

This is perhaps the hardest part. The questions you ask will determine what you find in the data. When thinking about questions, ponder proactively about what techniques you would use to answer them. This is where a broad set of modeling tools comes handy. That will be gone over in the next section.

**5. Analysis**

The most satisfying part in my opinion. When you wrote out your questions, hopefully you have some idea of what techniques you would use. That said, there are a lot of techniques to choose from and each technique has its own special niches. You will learn to select models properly from seeing a lot of data and practicing. Like everything else, practice, practice, practice. Try many models, run them on test sets using cross validation and see what works best. Learn about bias-variance trade-off. 

Generally statistical analysis is broken into 2 parts: 

In descriptive statistics we want to describe the patterns and structure of the data. If you did part 3 well, this will be partially taken care of. You can expand on this as the analysis comes along. 

In inferential statistics we want to predict from the data. This is what we are at now. 

Broadly speaking, this is the content that seems to be spread around the most. I will post some reccs to different courses / books that you will see floating around this subreddit (because they are great).

**Make sure you learn and understand cross validation extremely well.**

**Make sure to understand the assumptions behind each modeling technique you use. There is no one size fits all technique.** 

Since this is such a broad topic, go learn data analysis from books and courses. Learn models, figure out why you would want to use them, and then apply them. 

Once you have completed your modeling, make sure to create a visualization. If others will be seeing it, learn to explain things in simple terms as if non experts will see it. When you are being paid to be a data scientist, it is not about how intelligent you come across, it is about results and understanding for everyone.

[Think Stats: Data Analysis in Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/thinkstats2.pdf)

Harvard CS109 and R for Data Science linked in part 2.

Any other data analysis book you can find. 

**6. The Great Beyond**

After step 5, you are essentially a (good) data analyst. What will differentiate you now will be the extras. Heres some other stuff that you should probably look into: 

* Databases: SQL / Nosql / any query language really. 

* Data Engineering: Create pipelines and automate a lot of the legwork to make raw data usable. 

* Shell: Linux is cool, and bash scripting is useful

* Hadoop, Mapreduce, Spark, AWS, etc: Big Data

* Deep Learning : See what the hype is all about

* Time series analysis: Given the ubiquity of time series data, a book on TSA can't hurt

* Computer Science: Learn CS rigorously. Check out Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, CLRS Algorithms, Concepts, Techniques and Models of Computer Programming, and more. If you learn the concepts underlying the technologies you see, you won't be outdated nearly as easily. Tools may change, but the concepts and math stay the same. 

* Learn to love practicing. This list is daunting, but it is completely achievable one small step at a time. Setting aside time to learn and practice daily will get you farther than you could ever imagine. 



**Guide to Learning**

Like all other things in life, there are exciting things and less exciting things. What you find exciting is unique to you, but for the sake of this guide I will give how I would learn the content (assuming you know basic maths and programming): 

* Learn some data analysis. If using python, think stats is nice. If using R, R for Data Science is nice
* Learn how to clean and dissect data. If you read one of the books in the bullet above, you will have learned this.
* Now learn some visualization. Make it pretty with a book on ggplot or seaborn/matplotlib
* Now learn some better tools for analysis: Read and work through Intro to Statistical Learning or Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course. Ideally you would do both. 
* Learn database query languages. You will come across databases, so its best to be a wizard with them. 
* Learn hadoop / map reduce / spark for big data
* Learn the theory on a deeper level. [Probability Theory](http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/stat110) is great, Statistical Inference is great, Bayesian Inference and multilevel modeling is great. 
* Never stop learning

&#x200B;

Approach:

1. I will start off by posting top level comments as generic skill sets that are either business, technical, statistics and mathematics related.
2. Upvote the ones you believe are important core skill sets, but DO NOT downvote any other skills if you disagree/don't know is key. If you don't agree with a skill set not being core, simply don't upvote.
3. Leave your comments as second level comments so the top comments are always relating to the skills in question.
4. Add skills you think are important but you don't find them in top level comments.
5. By the end of the whole exercise, with enough votes, I believe we should then be able to see our crowdsourced key skills for this profession that are sought after and are important to being a good data scientist/analyst (note: my methodology may have loopholes, so please feel free to suggest some changes, I have a research methodology and statistics background but don't profess to be an expert, so comments welcomed)

In the center-of-excellence (CoE) model, also known as the research model, the expectation is that the data science team would work independently to identify big bets and build prototypes. Under this model, the data science team is considered to be the company‚Äôs innovation arm.

> __The Accounting Model__

> In the accounting model, also known as the BI model, the data science team would produce reports and presentations on a recurring basis (usually monthly and quarterly). The data science team would inform the organization of notable movements in top-level metrics. Once the team identifies an interesting trend, they would work with product teams to investigate the root cause. Thus, quite frequently, playing detective becomes a main part of the data science team under the accounting model.

> __The Consultant Model__

> In the consultant model, the data science team is assigned tickets or emailed with questions. Data science managers then prioritize the tickets and questions and assign them to data scientists.

> __The Embedded Model__

> In this model, product teams hire their own data scientists. Each engineering manager is in charge of planning for data scientist headcount, hiring, and allocation. The data scientist within each product team has the engineering team members as their peers.

> __The Democratic Model__

> In this model, it is believed that easy and straightforward access to data by product managers, designers, engineering managers, and engineers would lessen or remove the need for a data science role. Many identify the main need for hiring data scientists to be the lack of proper infrastructure for fast and easy dashboard creation.

> __The Product Data Science Model__

> Between the extremes of the fully centralized model (the CoE model) and the fully decentralized model (the embedded model), there exists a spectrum of hybrid models that take certain characteristics from each of the aforementioned models. Taking advantage of the strengths of both models, while actively making up for their deficiencies is what makes hybrid models successful.

> The product data science (PDS) model is inspired, in part, by the matrix structure. In this model, individuals are simultaneously part of the data science function and the product. Data scientists, each a member of a product team, report into a central data science team.

I'm a longtime lurker, looking to chat 1 on 1 with some people to fully understand day-to-day workflows and struggles of those working in data heavy roles. If you're open to video chat and sharing your personal experience, please message me.

In my most recent role, I led up data teams for an advertising agency, but never really got to the point where we could start using more advanced Data Science techniques. A lot of the time was just spent trying to get the right data set up, cleaned, and ensuring that the process was uniform across multiple clients. A lot of articles online seem to touch on the same issue - that data prep is 50%+ of the work.

From your experience, what are the biggest struggles you've faced as a Data Scientist? What frustrations do you keep running into? Are you using any automation to make your life easier?

Looking forward to hearing some of the responses!",0

As with many things, it‚Äôs often best to start with the basics. A generalist, when equipped with a few basic but well-understood tools, is surprisingly effective. Time spent really engaging with topics like the following will seldom be regretted!

Linear models and their modern extensions (GLMs, regularization)

Frequentist and Bayesian inference and its applications to experiments (bonus: causal inference, selection bias problems)

Optimization algorithms for fitting models (gradient methods, convex optimization)

Good engineering practices (organizing code, writing tests, version control)

As you learn, don‚Äôt worry about the cutting edge. Focus on the basics and you‚Äôll build a lasting foundation that will allow you to quickly reach the cutting edge of many different fields.

I think I'm a pretty smart, discerning person, but the things I've read and heard about this career are, as a whole, so confusing and so contradictory it's hard to know what to think.

Several months ago, after doing some research, I thought this was a viable path for me and that I had a plan to get into the field. Today, I don't know whether any of the things I believed about this career months ago are true, whether it's realistic for me to get a data science position in the near future, or whether this is a career I would even want.

I thought I'd list paraphrased version of some of the confusing and often contradictory things I've read and heard about this career for your amusement. If anyone has thoughts, by all means please comment, although at this point I don't think I'll believe anything anyone says about this stuff without experiencing it firsthand.

* Data science is a viable career path for people without a strong technical background who are willing to take a couple online courses.

* It's very straightforward to get a data scientist position if you have an advanced degree in any quantitative field, especially if you can code.

* It's almost impossible to get a data scientist position right out of (grad) school. No matter what field your degree was in, you probably need to spend a couple years working as a data analyst or BI person to get some domain expertise.

* Data science is a field with a serious talent shortage; companies are desperate for anyone who's at all qualified.

* The data science job market is flooded with applicants; any open job is going to get dozens if not hundreds of reasonably qualified applicants. It's really hard to get a job unless you seriously stand out. 

* The technical skills are the least important aspect. It's more important to work well with people and be a good communicator. You can easily learn the technical aspects on the job.

* A data scientist just needs to know more statistics than a programmer and more coding than a statistician.

* A data scientist needs to know all about optimization, numerical analysis, algorithms and data structures, and lots of advanced machine learning and statistics.

* The only things you really have to know are the fundamentals: be able to write some code in Python and R and know about confidence intervals and linear regression.

* In order to appeal to employers, it's crucial to have experience with the *exact technologies* the employer uses. If they use Hadoop, you must know Hadoop. Etc.

* There's no way to be a data scientist without knowing some pretty advanced math.

* Math isn't really relevant for data science in practice, and some of the most successful data scientists I know don't even know calculus.

* Data scientists spend their time working on intellectually challenging problems that are just as interesting as those in academia.

* Data scientists spend most of their time on boring data munging issues, usually with an ultimate goal of selling more shoes or some other horrible marketing thing.

* The data science field is really hot and will surely continue to grow for many years to come.

* Data science has hit its peak; it will continue to be useful in its areas of legitimate application, but companies are realizing it was oversold and they will be cutting back.

* There is an amazing amount of value to be had in data science.

* Most data scientists contribute nothing worthwhile to their employers.

* You must have a portfolio of projects to show employers.

* I don't know any data scientists with a portfolio of projects; my coworkers and I think that's a waste of time.

Here's another discouraging thing: looking at job ads for data scientist positions, there is such a crazy variety of skills and experience desired for each position. While I know that ""Required skills"" aren't always really required, it's pretty bewildering when:

* one position says you must have NLP experience;

* one says you must have cybersecurity experience;

* one says you must have Javascript and web programming experience (?!);

* one says you must have experience in the health care industry;

* one says you must have retail marketing experience;

* one says you must have bioinformatics experience;

* one says you must have experience in the intelligence community;

* one says you must have Django experience (?!);

* one says you must have experience with the Microsoft products SSMS, SSAS, and SSRS;

* one says you must know SAS;

* one says you must have experience in financial analysis.

In the above list, when I listed specific technologies, it was because they seem somewhat outside the standard data science toolkit, as far as I know. But even when they mention ""mainstream"" technologies, they vary so much between the different positions, and there is such a massive list. Different ones want AWS, Spark, Hadoop, Hive, Pig, PostgreSQL, MySQL, D3, Tableau, MapReduce, Flink, Mahout, MongoDB, Cassandra, and many more.

Judging by the ads, there is probably hardly anyone in the world who is qualified for more than one of these positions... and yet they are all ""data scientist"" positions.

Actually, I think half these employers just copy & pasted a bunch of buzzwords into their ads, but that's depressing for another reason.",0
727,Anyone wants to team up for doing Attribution Modelling in Marketing?,135,hgpx2j,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/hgpx2j/anyone_wants_to_team_up_for_doing_attribution/,164,"**\[Reached Max Limit\] H There. I've reached my max limit and will not be able to include any more people as of now but feel free to DM so I'd be aware that you'd want in if there's a chance. Thanks**

**The Project:**

Attribution modelling has been a common problem in the online marketing world. The problem is that people don't know which attribution model would work best for them and hence I feel Data Science has a big role to play here.

I'm working on a product that can generate user level data, basically which sources people come from and what actions they take. I also have some sample data to start working on this but we can always create artificial data using this sample.

I'm looking for like minded people who want to work with me on this and if we get any success, we can essentially turn this into a product.

That's too far fetched right now, but yeah, the problem statement exists and no solution exists for now, no convincing enough solution I'd say.

Let me know your thoughts. You don't have to be DS pro but interested enough in the problem statement

**\[Update\]** *Please let me know a bit about your experience as well and background if possible as I won't be able to include everyone. Note that this is just a project that you'd want to be in just for interest and learning*

*I'll create a slack group probably. I'll do this starting Monday. Keeping the weekend window open for people to get aware of this.*

**MY BACKGROUND:**

Working in Data Science field for 3 years, professionally 4 years. Mostly worked on blend of DS and Data Engineering projects.

In marketing, I've setup predictive pipelines and wrote a blog on Behavioral Marketing and a couple on DS. Other than this, I work on my SAAS tool on the side. Since I talk to people occasionally on different platforms, this specific problem statement has come up many times and hence the post

**FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NEW TO AM:**

Multitouch attribution OR Attribution Modelling basically seeks to figure out which marketing channels are contributing to KPIs and to find the optimal media-mix to maximize performance. A fully comprehensive attribution solution would be able to tell you exactly how much each click, impression, or interaction with branded content contributed to a customer making a purchase and exactly how much value should be assigned to each touchpoint. This is essentially impossible without being able to read minds. We can only get closer using behavioral data

**\[People Who Just Got Aware of This + Who DM Me\]**

Honestly, I did not expect a response like this, people have started to DM me. I'd be very upfront here, It won't be possible for me to include everyone and anyone for this project as it makes it harder to split the work and also the fact that some people might feel left out or feel the project isn't going on If I include everyone reaching out to me. The best mix would be people who are new and passionate, that brings in energy + who have already worked in something similar, that brings in experience.

But, this does not mean there won't be any collaboration at all. You've taken out time to reach out to me or comment here, I'd possible come up with a similar project in parallel and get you aligned there.

**\[Open To Feedback\]**

**If you think you can help in managing this project or have better way to set this up. Feel free to comment or DM**

**\[What Do You Get From This Project\]**

Experience, Learning, Networking. Nothing else. Just setting the expectations right!

**\[When Does It Start\]**

Next week definitely. I'll setup a slack group as a first and share few docs there. I'm planning Monday late evening to send out the invites. I'll push this to Wednesday max if I have to!

**\[How To Comment/DM\]**

Feel free to write in your thoughts, but it'd help me in filtering out people among different skills. So, please add a tag like this in your comments based on your skills:

* **#only\_pythoncoding** \-> Front-line people, who'll code in python to do the dirty stuff
* **#marketing\_and\_code** \-> People who can code and also know the market basics
* **#only\_marketing** \-> If you're more of a non-tech who can mentor/share thoughts
* **#only\_stats\_analytical** \-> People who have stats background but not much experienced in code/market",0

729,Warning - Tableau Prep is dangerously broken,136,ewrjpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/ewrjpe/warning_tableau_prep_is_dangerously_broken/,57,"So, disclaimer. This is mostly a vent from someone who works mainly with operational data and is not a hard 'Data Scientist'. If you have clean, reliable data sources your BI/IT department maintains on your behalf, your experience may be very different. **This is a warning for the other low-code Ops Data mungers and wrangles; the target audience for Tableau Prep.**

**Context**:

For those not in the know, Tableau Prep was a long teased breakout of the Data Connection interface baked into Tableau *Desktop*. Prep has been out of beta for (checks notes) about two years.

As someone who mainly relies on unclean tables from dozens of departments and third-party enterprise platforms, Tableau is uncontested IMHO for getting the shape of data needing wrangling.

I often explain my use of Tableau Desktop to being equivalent to how 90% of people use Photoshop. Sure, it's overkill. There are more powerful or specialized tools out there.

But dragging a CSV into Tableau Desktop and getting a sense of the data structure/distribution is painless. If you're so inclined, you can also build out a semi-automated workflow that connects to your db and dynamically formats visuals; it spits out pretty PDFs to emails and internal customers can view dashboards. For quick turnaround and ad-hoc reporting, it's f'ing great.

**The issue with Tableau Prep: It's not just buggy, but** ***dangerously unstable***

The [UI is slick and intuitive](https://help.tableau.com/current/prep/en-us/Img/prep_union3.png), making Unions/Joins happen in near-real time and leveraging Tableau's formulas to execute basic but powerful value manipulation. [It natively connects to pretty much any data source.](https://www.tableau.com/products/prep#data-sources) It spits out CSV or .hyper (Tableau packaged extracts)  cleanly. It's a more accessible version of Alteryx with the bonus of being bundled into the Tableau Server suite, taking out a bunch of overhead.

It's great! Until it's not.

Join too many sources (\~5+) in a single union and it hangs regardless of the table size. Make too many changes in a step (ex. rename 50 fields) and it hangs. Join larger tables on fields that have null values and it'll likely lock up before you can catch the issue.

Annoying? Sure, but not end of the world. **Where it's nightmare fuel is how it handles errors and low-resource warnings.**

It gives a error notification, sometimes a soft one.

Then it loops for a while.

Then, *maybe* it'll let you save. More likely, it's going to freeze out the UI while it works indefinitely.

The more changes, the more steps, the more sources you have, the more likely it's going to loop forever and lock your work away in a frozen process with no way to recover. **Half the time, force-killing the hung executable is going to corrupt Tableau Prep's tmp/log files holding the sample data it uses for staging, making earlier versions go straight to the same unrecoverable error state.** You *can* regenerate a new tmp/log files by creating a flow from scratch using 'new' data sources, but good luck recovering your existing saved steps from Prep when it's in the endless-loop state.

After speaking with some more skilled individuals, I've decided to avoid Tableau Prep and just script transformations outside of the Tableau suite entirely. SQL and Python still get the job done. Missing Prep's real-time previews it takes longer having to constantly check output samples, but I'm never at risk of losing days (or weeks) of work to one messy join statement.

**Edit:** Rereading this and some of my comments, realizing how frustrated I was while writing it.

Thanks everyone for the support, good to know I'm not crazy for going back to more manual scripting.

I stand by my statement that Tableau Prep is soul-crushingly broken.",0

1. **Only flaired users can make new submissions without mod approval.**  Non-flaired users can comment on any submission, but any new submission of theirs must be approved by a moderator.

2. **Beginner questions about getting into Data Science may only be made to the ""beginner"" sticky submission.**  This can include those just starting out or those trying to change their career.  The sticky threads will be archived at some interval, which will be determined later.  An archival list will be kept for beginners to be directed towards.

3. **Additional moderators are required.** This is in order to facilitate quicker submission and user flair approval/rejection.

Furthermore, link and user flair categories will need to be updated to reflect these changes.  However, this may hold off until the new reddit site redesign is complete due to changes in how flair filtering works.

When you are learning and have a new teacher rotating basically every session, they have no idea what the instructor before them has delved into and what style they are teaching from.

A few of the teachers would literally stand up with the physically printed solved code and just read from the code while typing it back into their computer. With one teacher, the code wouldn‚Äôt work and he basically said ‚ÄòYou get the jist, but we have to move on for time‚Äôs sake...‚Äô

Since we are so behind in the curriculum, they have added in Friday night sessions (on top of our 3 other days a week). I understand that I am making an investment in my future, but some balance is needed in life. We still have homework and group projects outside of class.

Responsibilities grew to that of a normal Senior Data Scientist within 6 months and will double by the beginning of next year. If a promotion isn't possible, how can I make the most of my situation, whether increasing compensation, refusing too much work, etc?

Hi guys,

I'm in a bit of precarious situation and I hope you guys would be able to help. I'm a new age Data Scientist (mix of Business Intelligence using SQL/R/Python/Tableau and using ML for impact analysis, but no data engineering or production-level ML modeling). At the beginning of this year, I left academia (previously PhD. Candidate) with an MSc. in electrical engineering. I applied and was accepted into a big funded start-up (think Alibaba level). From the long interview process, I was rated as barely a Senior DS; worried that I couldn't keep up due to my lack of experience, I pushed to become an Associate DS with a salary close to a Senior DS (based on my market analysis), which was accepted.

However, in the span of 6 months, I went from working with 1 Product Manager (PM) with 1 product to 2 PMs with 3 products. Now, by end of January, due to reorgs (no layoffs though), I'm now asked to **solely** handle 6 PMs with 9 products. According to my company's DS career ladder, I'm qualified to be a Senior DS when I work with 2-3 PMs and 4+ products, and these requirements are pretty consistent with the actual responsibilities of the Senior DSs I'm friends with. However, my manager has already stated that while a promotion is ""on the table"", I likely don't have the work experience nor enough time spent in the company to be considered for a promotion yet. Promotions requires multiple levels of approval, so it isn't purely based on my manager's discretion.

If a promotion isn't possible anytime soon, is it possible to ask for a salary increase or refuse part of the increased responsibilities? My responsibilities and products has increased dramatically in terms of scale, scope, and complexity (from minor, add-on features to features handling a ton of our revenue), let alone dealing with constant stakeholder management and context switching due to the highly varied products. I want to accept the increased responsibilities, but I myself am not sure whether I can handle everything; I feel like my current limit is 5-6 products, but I did grow from struggling with 1 product to comfortably handling 3 products in 4 months. Would talking to the Head of DS department help? We have done multiple skip level meetings in the past, but not for a sensitive topic like this.

What would you do in my situation? Let me know if there's a better place to ask for advice. I think this is an appropriate place due to being relatable and maybe a question on many DS's minds, given the constant influx of new talent into the industry.

EDIT: During my salary negotiation, it was agreed upon that I would mostly be  working at local-level projects, so I was given a local salary. My MSc. is from a top 20 US university, but I work in a 3rd world country, while the headquarters is at a 1st world country; thus, my salary is 4-5x less than my headquarters counterparts. In my last quarter, I was indeed only working on 1 local product/feature. However, this quarter, I worked on 1 local and 1 regional-level product/feature. I needed to fly to the headquarters cross-country at least once  a week per month. Now, by the end of January, they'll be expecting me to work on 1 local and 8 regional products/features. I'll likely need to fly over at least 2 weeks per month to maintain my quality/speed of work and for effective stakeholder management. Thus, there's also a local vs regional component to my issue.",0

Work experience- employers prize work experience over so many things.

Employers notice your application over other candidates and they might give you a salary bump because of the work experience.

I'm trying to predict which P2P borrowers will default/charge off a loan. 

In the first iteration, I used only my own investment data to create a binary classification of those who paid back their loans (0) and those who defaulted (1). The problem lies in the ratio of available data: 99% of people paid, and 1% defaulted. So the NN has learned to predict that 100% of people will pay their loans and can still report 99% accuracy.

I found a much bigger data set (about 850k items vs. my original 4k) with the hope that throwing more data at the model might help. Unfortunately, the overall ratio is the same: 99% paid and 1% defaulted. This results in the same inaccurate prediction.

So experts, can you share any advice on how to approach this kind of problem? I was wondering if it's a logical approach to alter the ratio of the training set, i.e. use less of the data overall so that 1% becomes 25%. Alternatively, I am only using 2 features in the initial NN. Could adding more complexity with additional features improve the accuracy?

I previously posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6znbdo/data_analyst_one_month_in/) about a my background and a little bit about my job. 

In the past year, I have been promoted from analyst I to analyst II and have been accepted to GT analytics program, which my company has agreed to pay for 70% of tuition and 100% of other fees, while working full time.

I work for a natural gas company and continue to do marketing analytics. In my first year, I have gotten very very very familiar with SQL, and cleaning lots and lots of data (shout out tidyverse). I am lucky enough that my team is small and my work requires me to go from pulling the data, to cleaning the data, to ultimately building a model if necessary. 

There are certain things that I have learned through out my year as an analyst 

* Ask questions. Often if you don't know what is going on with the data someone else does. People tend to be helpful especially when you are starting out. 

* Assume the model you built is too good to be true if you are getting some amazing results. Often times there is some data leakage issue that you did not see immediately, but your skepticism will help you catch that. 

* Build things because there is a dollar amount associated with the knowledge created from your analysis. Nobody cares that you have a cool ML algorithm if it does not save or make the company any money. 

* Always have a simple baseline model to compare more complex models to. Losing easily interpreted coefficients should not be taking lightly. How much more accuracy is worth losing that occasional more actionable insight?

* Get comfortable with SQL, like really comfortable and be prepared to clean data and write views for other people... 

* Comment and version control your code. Bitbucket, github, vsts or whatever you use is your friend. 

* Create pipelines to help with reproducible work. Shout out [drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake) and [airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/). 

Ask to help others on their projects and please please learn about the company, the business' needs, and goals before building some crazy model. Often times a simple approach is just as good as a black box ML model (not saying all the time). Overall my year as an analyst has been great and I have been fortunate enough to have a boss that is hands off and is willing to take the fall for my mistakes.

I couldn't create any algorithms and I'd have difficultly giving explanations of basic statistics concepts at the moment. I've done some R and Python, so I could be told what to do. But I couldn't implement anything fancy. 

I see a lot of things about reading papers, fancy algorithms, models, programming, advanced statistics and maths stuff.... but that's clearly not something that I'm going to be applying for. But maybe there are roles on the peripheries that I'm not aware of? I'm not sure. 

There's a lot of content for people who're very capable, but I rarely see much for people who're just standard / average or whatever. So I'm curious whether there's advice about what kind of things are out there for someone like that. 

This isn't a case of being negative or whatever, I find it quite annoying when things are phrased in those terms. It's just the situation that I'm in, because of who I am. So I'm not fishing for  any sort of ""you can do it!"" (*it* being learn advanced stuff and so on) sentiments. 

I'm hoping that I can leave with a reasonable understanding of basic statistics. Regression, hypothesis testing. Along with *some* programming, and hopefully a project that I've implemented.

TL:DR; **Loading .npy files is ~70x faster than .csv files. This actually adds up to a lot if you - like me - find yourself restarting your kernel often when you've changed some code in another package / directory and need to process / load your data again!**

Obviously there's some limitations like the use of header / column names, but this is entirely possible to save and load using a .npy file, it's just a little more cumbersome compared to .csv formats.

It's not a common thing where I'm from, so I hoped someone can help me with some advice. 

At our store, farmers can get cash or a product as a loan. After some time the farmer needs to repay the cash/product, but they are not always able to do that. My Credit Score model should be able to decide who's allowed access to which product, in order to minimize the risk of the loans.

I'm thinking of building a model that predicts if someone will repay or not, but I have a question about this: If a farmer is allowed to get a more ""risky"" product, he is less likely to repay, but the reason he was allowed to get the product was that he got a low default probability. Would this distort the model at some point? I can imagine that a good credit score model causes the probability to repay the same for both risky as non-risky clients, just because the non-risky clients are allowed to behave more risky.

782,"Data Analytics ""Lite"" a.k.a. the colourful and pretty world of drag-and-drop tools",131,bb7581,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bb7581/data_analytics_lite_aka_the_colourful_and_pretty/,69,"Hi all, short time lurker, first time poster (hopefully I don't break any rules) - as you can see from my username, I am a new user.

Not sure if there has been a similar discussion before but I'm interested in this sub's opinion of things that I call 'data analytics ""lite""'. By that, I specifically mean visually based tools which do not involve real code.

A bit about me: I work in a company that uses Alteryx and Tableau to do the majority of their data analysis. In the past few months, I've realised that there is so much more scope out there for data analysis and data analytics beyond Alteryx and Tableau; namely, things like machine learning, statistical modelling using R, and using languages like Python to do... stuff (not sure exactly what it can do but I've only heard good things).

Recently, when I tried to transition into a more ""technical"" data analytics role that uses Python, R, and SQL, I've been shooed away because of an apparent skill gap. I've got this impression that people think that because I don't actually code at the moment for work, because I use 'drag-and-drop' tools like Tableau/Alteryx, that I don't have the skills to do the ""real"" stuff.

It frustrates me because I learned coding at university and took to it like a fish to water. Moreover, it's not as if I've been sitting around doing nothing - I work with data everyday, it's just usually in csv/Excel/txt format so I use Alteryx instead of SQL, and I don't visualise using ggplot2, but I chuck it into Tableau.

It's just unfortunate I suppose that the line of work I got into after uni is about business-facing analytics and with a heavy emphasis on explanation to stakeholders. After all, what's easier to explain to a non-technical person, a pretty Alteryx workflow that neatly splits out and joins the data, or 100 lines of SQL with SELECT this and INNER JOIN that?

I suppose what I want to get out of posting this is - what the role is of these drag-and-drop tools in organisations that do data analytics, whether learning and honing skill in these is even useful, and how those of us who are using these can transition into the seemingly greener pasture of actual data analytics coding/programming (and is it actually greener?).

795,My Review: Unimpressed with Datacamp (for Python),128,8n4ui3,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/8n4ui3/my_review_unimpressed_with_datacamp_for_python/,45,"I don't know what subreddit is best for this post. Sorry if it's not this one.

So I'm a data analyst, not a data scientist. I just finished grad school (not data science) and I'm between jobs and about to move to a new city, so I've been taking the last few weeks to go through Datacamp's material fairly intensely (~4 hours a day) to upgrade my skills before I get my hopes and dreams crushed by the job market.

...


The **first** thing I noticed about Datacamp was that they did a lot of stuff *for* me. I'd open up an exercise and most of the code had been written already, with a couple of spaces with '____' where I should fill in the right answer. I thought this was really frustrating, because there was never any point in the process where they explained to me why we needed to perform whatever operation it was. I'm like 50 hours in, and I'm not sure I could do any of this without Datacamp's prompting. I think this is the worst part of the Datacamp curriculum. I feel that I'm paying Datacamp to teach me Python syntax and when to use it (not just how to use it), and I feel like I'm not learning either of those things.

**Second,** although Datacamp courses offer short video segments that putatively ""teach"" the course, the exercises were essentially big text boxes. Oftentimes the video and text would be somewhat out of sync, and sometimes it felt like entire sections had been omitted between text and video. This made watching the videos almost completely optional, and considering most of them are shorter than 5 min, there was never enough time to substantively introduce the material anyway.

**Third**, the exercises rarely feel practical. There are some nice real-world datasets used, but because of what I describe in my first paragraph, it's hard to actually interface with them. You're not really working with them yourself. Beyond that, it doesn't feel like Datacamp spends a lot of time trying to motivate the problem. Why do we need to take this approach, etc. There are often domain-specific considerations that influence how the problem may best be solved, and that stuff is completely omitted. This ends up meaning that these supposedly practical exercises end up anything but.

I had a really long paragraph here about how **I dislike their two-part statistics course**. TL;DR: I thought the treatment of linear regression was really shallow and incomplete (there's no mention of residuals at all, for example), and I thought leaving out multiple and logistic regression meant it didn't provide enough for students to actually learn how to work with data. I've never worked as a data scientist, but I understand that those two are important. They're already super useful as an analyst.

**That's not to say that Datacamp is terrible.** I really liked some of the data viz stuff they've got (Seaborn and Bokeh are awesome), and I think their first couple of intro to Python courses are helpful. I've heard great things about their R courses, as well. And Datacamp has got a great platform for what they're doing.

I'm certainly going to finish my month of Datacamp, but I don't think I'll be resubscribing. I know it's kind of a cheap shot, but I feel like I might subscribe to one of their competitor products in the hope that they can teach me more of the syntax and thought process behind this stuff. I'm disappointed to be paying somebody to teach me, only to have to Google what they're supposed to be teaching.",0

I'm a 4th year PhD student in political science at a top 10 university in my field. I'm hitting that stage in my program where I am highly questioning whether it is for me, whether I like it, and whether I'm cut out for it. I have few circulating papers but the publish or parish mentality is getting to me.

Also, truth is, I kind of just prefer coding in R. That is my favorite part of the job usually. I'm happier when I am RAing for a professor who tells me ""here, do X,Y,Z, merge these data sets, run this analysis, and summarize what you find for me"" than I am reading poli sci work, doing my own research, and dealing with reviewers.   


  
I'm relatively fluent with R and have a foundational understanding of advanced statistics but I am not methodologist. I can merged datasets, aggregate and summarize data, run regressions and generalized linear models (and understand outputs), design quasi-experiments like DiDs and regression discontinuety designs, know when to adjust SEs, cluster, etc. I know some basic text-anlysis including how to use cosign-similarity scores and supervised learning methods (a bit of unsupervised methods but not much as to how it works). I'm definetly not developing R packages yet though.

I also know a fair amount of GIS in R and through ArcGIS. I've dipped my toes in Python but only for certain specfici uses (needed certain packages that predict race/ethnicity and to parse certain file types). I don't really know SQL but it does not seem to hard to learn.

I have 2 years of work experience in a non-profit foundation.

&#x200B;

I was hoping for some career advice. If I do make the call to not pursue academia at all (I'm like 90% of the way there), what can I do to improve my chances at a data science/marketing analytics type of role. Options I am considering:

* Finishing my PhD quick and dirty. My committee is generally friendly and I think they would understand if I just wanted to be done and submitted a mediocer dissertation. I could do this in about 9 months. 
* Drop out now. Look for a job with what I got. Seems like a terrible idea during the middle of a pandemic though.
* Stay in the program for now. Continue to get my stipend/TA for living funds. Do a coding/ data science bootcamp and leave after that is done (learn SQL and maybe Python + industry specifics not learned in academia).  

* Stay in the program for now. Work torwards the PhD. Apply to jobs while staying in the program. State in my letters that I am interested in a career switch. If some thing good comes up, make the jump. Otherwise,   


Does anyone have any suggestions on what I should do to improve my chances of landing a job? Do I have decent chance of landing an industry job with my skill set? I'm not super picky about the exact industry though I would prefer something not in a ""moral questions"" sector (military/oil/etc). I am currently living in Los Angeles and open to relocation at any major US city, preferably on the West coast.

Considering that the ideal Data Scientist is supposed to be an expert at software development, databases, statistics, mathematics, machine learning, deep learning, I often wonder how work actually gets done in teams in say a real job.

If you look at other professions say Game development, which pretty much is focused on pushing out a software product (the game) to consumers, the job titles are often clearly defined, and normally broken down into distinct roles of Developer, Artist, Writer and Composer. This is just a gross exaggeration for a  typical indie team (AAA games would have legions of employees), but it is still quite rare if one person does everything.

Now, back to data science - if you had people with PhDs in Maths, Statistics, Computer Science or Physics, how are the tasks even delegated if everyone on the team is at the same education or expertise level? Taking the typical Data Science workflow in mind, surely one of them would be extremely annoyed if all they were assigned to do was data cleaning?

804,So you want to be a data scientist‚Ä¶,125,2vomul,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/2vomul/so_you_want_to_be_a_data_scientist/,57,"I‚Äôve noticed a bunch of posts here that are of the form ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a X major and want to be a data scientist, what do I do?‚Äù so I thought I would chime in and give my opinion.  I hire data scientists so I thought I would tell you what I look for when I‚Äôm hiring newbies.  Experienced people are another story. 

First, you need to be able to code.  And I‚Äôm more interested in hacking skills more than formal systems development. If you need a formal requirements document and 6 agile sprints to complete a data science engagement you are taking too long.  Besides, 50%-70% of your work will be taking the crappy data you are given and putting it in a form that can be analyzed. For that you‚Äôll need PERL, Python, VB, etc.  After you have done it you probably don‚Äôt need to do it again in the exact same way.  So you need to hack that mother.  It would be awesome if you had minions to do the shit work for you but let‚Äôs face it, if you are just coming out of school you are the minion.  I knew people in grad school that got straight A‚Äôs but couldn‚Äôt program their way out of a paper bag.  I don‚Äôt want those people.  So convince me that you can write code. 

You need to understand data.  This seems to be under represented in ‚Äúhow to be a data scientist‚Äù posts but it is very important.  But  you need to have a good feel for data representation and modeling.  Sooner or later you will need to impose structure on data or the data that is given to you will be highly structured.  Being able to put your data in the correct form can make all the difference in the world when it comes to accuracy and speed of analysis.  

You need to be curious.  If you see a dead squirrel on the top floor of a parking garage and your first thought is ‚ÄúEwwwww, a dead squirrel‚Äù I don‚Äôt want you.  If you first thought is ‚ÄúHmmm, why did that squirrel come up here if there are no trees nearby? There isn‚Äôt any squirrel food around to draw him in.   How did he die? I assume that he was hit by a car but is that really the case?‚Äù  and  you go into full CSI:Rodent mode then you are someone I want to talk to.  If something slightly odd pops up during your analysis it could be your mistake, bad data or an interesting discovery.  All of these are important but if you don‚Äôt notice and follow up on the initial oddity then we‚Äôll never know will we?  I understand if you keep that side of you under wraps around normal people.  I do as well. My friends and close relatives all think I‚Äôm strange when I start wondering out loud about things like that.  If you haven‚Äôt read all the Sherlock Holmes stories then maybe you should.  However, that being said don‚Äôt take it too far.  I‚Äôve seen stats people go down rabbit holes for weeks and come back with a set of technically correct but complete useless results.  This is especially true with big data systems.  There are an infinite number of cool but useless things you can find. Your curiosity should always be filtered though the sieve of practicality.  Just keep asking yourself if what you are investigating will ultimately be useful to the client. 

You need imagination.  There are multiple ways to approach any analytic problem and you need to be able to see most of those.  More importantly you need to be able to imagine entirely brand new problems that can be solved with the data and tools that you have.  If you only find what you are told to find you are a failure.  Convince me that you can see things that others can‚Äôt.  Unless what you see are hallucinations then please keep those to yourself.  



Tell me a story.   You need to be able to convert your brilliant analysis into something that normal people can understand.  If you use the term ‚Äúp-value‚Äù while explaining results to a client I‚Äôll dock your pay.  Unless you are lucky enough to have a client that understands all that stuff. Then by all means, geek out.  You need to have good communications skills.  You need to explain your results, why they are significant and why someone should trust them in a way that civilians understand.  You will also need to interact with clients on a continual basis since you may understand analytic techniques but you most likely won‚Äôt understand the domain you are working in.  A big part of data science is learning about the business domain you are operating in. If you don‚Äôt, you run the risk of embarrassing yourself by giving clients results that are obviously wrong or trivial.  My first results that I delivered to a client many years ago were horribly wrong because of some fundamentally incorrect assumptions I made about the completeness of the data that I would have known about had I asked. And they were completely obtuse.  My work product sucked and I paid the price.  

Finally, you need an area of technical analytic expertise.  This is where your background in stats, machine learning,  natural language processing, etc. comes in.  There isn‚Äôt much to really say here.  If you are coming out of school  this is what your degree should be in or you need to have shown a significant project or two in these areas.  You should be able to describe how to solve a sample problem that I throw at you using your preferred technology. I expect you to be technically competent in one area and conversant in the rest. 

Hmmm, this was way longer than I thought it would be.  Hopefully it helps.  Of course additions, comments and vicious flames welcome.

809,How to step data science game up ?,125,9wd9qb,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9wd9qb/how_to_step_data_science_game_up/,18,"Hi Guys,

First, a bit of context. I am currently finishing my Master Degree in Industrial Engineering with a focus on Business Analytics and Machine Learning. I have a bit work experience through internships in Data Science (Python, R, SQL...), quite a good knowledge of statistics/econometrics and ML fundamentals and currently learning better the unix command line / basic sysadmin.

However, browsing job descriptions, I realize I definitely lack the knowledge of the *full stack* of the Data Science pipeline. I still work more like a scientific researcher in a lab rather than a full-fledged data science in industry. I have no idea on how to put a model into production, nor do I know anything about tools frequently seen in jobs descriptions or used in real life such as docker, jenkins, kubernetes, spark, AWS beyond the basics ...

I ideally wish to gather a  comprehensive understanding of the elements needed to put a model in production from end to end. (e.g., data retrieval and processing, alerting, errors and exceptions handling, reporting ...)

What do you think are the *most important things* one should learn ?",0

Because the industry gives the ""Data Scientist"" title to people with differing levels of data-related skillsets, everything from generating reports to building machine learning models, comparing Data Scientist roles just by title or years of experience isn't enough--getting down to the comparison of skills and role is more useful. 

I've run into this while trying to collect more data about a Data Scientist's salary to use in future negotiations and understand my market value. My employer, like most I imagine, is pretty tight lipped about what others in my role make, and opaque about how they arrive at compensation numbers, so I hope this post helps us all a little.

I'd like to share that information with the community in the hopes that others will do the same, giving us all a bunch of data points where we can say to our employers ""I heard of Data Scientist X making Y doing Z in NYC"". Here it is, and thanks for everyone's participation!

* Location: NYC
* Title: Data Scientist
* Education level: Bachelors in Computer Science
* Industry/vertical: software-as-a-service tech company
* Company size: 500-1000
* Majority of time spent using (tools): Python, pandas, Spark, Jupyter Notebook, SQL
* Majority of time spent doing (role): writing ETLs, data analysis, reporting for A/B tests, communication to influence the product, building dashboards for monitoring metrics
* Compensation: $104k salary, some options, no bonus

Edit: Before making this post, I had already used Paysa, Glassdoor, Stackoverflow's Salary Tool, h1bdata.com, and O'Reilly's model/report to compare my salary. But I'm always looking for more data points, and this is a different kind of data that'll be helpful to the community!",0

**Education/Skills**: BA in Math and Economics, now mastering out of a quantitative social science PhD program. During my program, I've developed considerable expertise in econometrics and causal inference.

**Second round phone interviews**: 7

**Onsite interviews**: 3

**Offers**: 1

[Dbplyr](https://db.rstudio.com/dplyr/) allows users to work with remote data stored in databases as if it was in-memory data. Basically, it translates dplyr verbs into SQL queries. Crucially, it has two enormous advantages over simply sending out SQL queries through a connection:

&#x200B;

>The most important difference between ordinary data frames and remote database queries is that your R code is translated into SQL and executed in the database, not in R. When working with databases, dplyr tries to be as lazy as possible:

>It never pulls data into R unless you explicitly ask for it.  
>  
>It delays doing any work until the last possible moment: it collects together everything you want to do and then sends it to the database in one step.

I'm looking for a similar package for Python.

Blaze appears to have been more popular than Ibis, but seems to have gone almost completely stale some years ago, while Ibis is in active development. I haven't yet been able to figure out if they offer the same ""laziness"" of dbplyr, so if anyone could clear that out for me, it would be greatly appreciated.

I‚Äôm not too sure how we will achieve this, maybe a variational Autoencoder, or we simply find the closest centroid for data of our choice and sample from the centroid (this is the added restriction that our data is distributed in different ways as we are working with real estate data)

Given the problem, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs important we have very clearly defined clusters, but
I‚Äôm just getting my head in a real knot knowing when it‚Äôs good enough, and my boss has said it‚Äôs entirely up to me.

853,Pivoting FROM Data Science to CS?,121,fcux6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/fcux6f/pivoting_from_data_science_to_cs/,42,"I recently (8 months ago) entered the data science sphere after finishing a PhD in a physical science. While it has been extremely enjoyable, especially when compared with academia, I am finding myself more interested in the computer science/programming side rather than the statistics/modeling side of data science. Has anyone had any experience in making this sort of transition, i.e. AWAY from DS to CS? There are plenty of resources for the inverse, but not too much available for this path from what I can find.

Now, I haven't exactly had a CS course or anything like that, I just had to pick up programming during my PhD. I'd say I have a passible understanding of Fortran and C++ from my research, and a decent understanding of Python from my current job. I understand that those skills probably not what would be in demand, but I find that picking up other languages gets easier the more I get exposed to, and more importantly the process behind programming is quite attractive to me. I understand if a CS degree would be worthwhile to pick up, although I am rather burnt out on schooling after 4 years of undergrad and 5 years of graduate school.

I appreciate any thoughts!

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for all of your comments.

I'm adding an edit to hopefully give a summary for myself and anyone else who stumbles along this post. I'll try to make the results more applicable too given that not everyone has a PhD.

People seem to indicate that there are various paths one could take as a data scientist to transition into a more CS position:

* **Backend developer** **-** would basically entail a clean break from data science in essence; take that as you will. Working with web systems and databases most likely. 
* **DE/MLE -** staying in the ""Data Science Field""**^(TM)**, just moving away from the analysis and into more of the guts of the infrastructure/algorithm deployment. Think big data management or taking your crappy Jupyter notebook and turning into a deployable code framework, optimizing, etc.
* **Quant -** probably the hardest transition, usually reserved for people with post-graduate degrees in a highly technical field. Applying statistical models to the financial sector, predicting what to buy/sell, etc. ",0

860,Data Analyst- One Month In,118,6znbdo,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/6znbdo/data_analyst_one_month_in/,18,"Hi everyone, 

I browse this subreddit quite a bit. Actually it is the first thing I do when I get to work in the morning. I see a lot of posts about data analyst positions and I thought I would share my current experience one month in. 

A little about myself: I graduated from a very good small liberal arts school not super well known for its science and math programs. But I graduated with a degree in physics and a minor in math. My math minor which included probability models, applied statistics in R, mathematical statistics (proofs of t-test and other things you never want to prove like the Rao-Blackwell theorem), and bayesian statistics with R. I chose work over grad-school because I was unsure exactly what field I wanted to go into and did not want to spend money on a degree that would not further my career. I think the biggest thing that set me apart when I was interviewing was my demonstration that I can learn on my own. Personal projects were something that interviewers were very curious about and I was happy to show them a web-scrapper I built or a website with MySQL developed in django. 

A little bit about my job: I work as a marketing analyst for a natural gas company trying to bring insight into different strategies and predict a variety of different things. This means I do all the sexy things like cleaning data, cleaning data, and cleaning data. I currently use python and R for a lot of my data manipulation. Our company actual uses PowerBI for visualization and reports and it is horribly slow, but very free. Coming out of undergrad I was excited to dive right into applied machine learning algorithms and tried to learn as much as I can about that. But, I think the most important thing is curiosity and wanting to learn about the actual business itself. It is impossible to be a good data analyst if you don't know why the data is being presented to you the way it is. In order to answer interesting questions, you first need to be able to ask them and that all starts with playing with the data and visualizations (EDA!!), not just throwing a random forest regression, SVM, or naive bayes algorithm from scikit-learn. 

Overall it has been a great experience. My math training has been the most useful to me so far, SQL skills have been slowly improving, and I have yet to use any bayesian tricks which I thought was the coolest thing I have every learned, except for solid state physics. 
 
Please pm with questions, I am happy to share my resume. I just recently went through this process and would be happy to talk about my interview experience and all the times I had to fail in order to get the job I have today. Learn how to make reports and try to enjoy it because it is going to be a big part of being a data analyst. I am going to work on some data pipeline stuff using luigi in python, so I would love to hear if anybody has suggestions or things to watch out for, let me know!

Just wanted to say thank you all on this subreddit. I never learned about training imbalanced classifiers in school and I was able to create and properly train my model thanks to y'all. ",0

864,The REAL confusion of starting a journey into Data Science,122,9f85hv,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/9f85hv/the_real_confusion_of_starting_a_journey_into/,58,"...is the maddeningly different views each DS has. Don't take this as an insult to the group; its an observation.

I suffer from an inability to make decisions and actions, therefore even with clear guidance I struggle to pick a starting point and stick to it. One major contributing factor to this is my compulsive need to read all the ""getting starting,"" articles possible, and the threads that go with it. And while I understand my short comings regarding picking a starting point / plan. Others seem to be having the same problem who may or may not have as much industry knowledge as I do.

In every article there are 2 maybe 3 views, coding, the math and DL:

- Without fail theres always the guys who say just start playing with it, find a dataset you like and find a problem you want to solve and go. I liked this approach and started this way. :)

- Then the comments start on this thread, where its identified if you don't know the math, you are doing it wrong and you don't even know it. ok... makes sense... buuuuuut do I keep chugging along with my project or start taking math courses (overly simplified response but you get the idea)? This is where my spiral starts, and now I'm watching videos on statistics, how to read research papers, taking khan courses on statistics and coursera courses on ML; all while trying to do my project that got me really into this in the first place.

- Then comes the deep learning discussion, ""if you really don't know how do use the right algorithm, its not even worth trying."" Which in my mind is really the same discussion as the math comment but further down that road. 

I don't know if its an opinion of those who do it for fun vs professionally vs academically (or of theres a difference between professional & academic). Its just hard to pick a starting point when the opinions are so vastly different. I know I know, its the internet - but data science is the search for truth within the numbers, maybe we can collectively agree on an approach. Even if its professional vs fun.... Academic I will assume starts with school and ends with school...

My opinion from what I have read thus far:

Professional:

 - Make sure you have a strong understanding of statistical distributions 
 - Make sure you atleast have a foundation of high level math: linear algebra, calculus, discrete mathematics...etc
 - Hypothesis testing and optimization
 - Python / R / SQL / other coding basics
 - Algorithms and training data
 - Start your own projects via kaggle or similar
 - Build your own data set via gathering, cleaning and normalizing and create models / predictions to prove a problem you find
 - Do the above a lot until you have enough to quantify your knowledge on a resume
 - Apply

Fun:

 - Get Math
 - Have coding understanding
 - Know what an algorithm is and how to apply it - read about how it works at some point
 - Follow a Kaggle or similar, tutorial a few times
 - Try an example yourself or find a problem to solve for youself and start

***Above all share your work - regardless of which path you take.***

As I may have stated, I am still very new myself - so the paths above are truly from someone who doesn't know, I just didn't feel right saying hey you guys are smart explain how to do this differently. So I took a stab at a starting point. 

If you got to this point, thank you very much for reading!

I was at a Google Cloud Platform training seminar the other day as my company is beginning to adopt it for our day-to-day use. One of the speakers (manager of DS at another firm) mentioned how they had high preference for software engineers, because *""its easier to provide DS tools to a coder than to teach an analyst how to code""*.

With the exposure of DS I've had over the past year or two, I've gathered that the general sentiment is to code and be great at math/stats. When I look at the influencers in this space, I see people with PhDs in math/physics or some sort of proven programming background.

As for myself, I graduated with a business degree and I've maintained a career today because I'm well-versed in web/mobile analytics. When I perform my analysis, I'm essentially using analytics platforms (e.g. Adobe/Google), SQL when looking at online-offline data and spreadsheets to discover insights; like any BA would.

However, in my space, I'm slowly noticing data scientists build presence in the business space; like unicorns that can code, run models and *present analysis + insights.* And when I'm looking for other web/mobile related jobs, Python and R are already job description standards. I feel that BAs won't have the competitive advantage to compete against data scientists with software and/or doctorate backgrounds in the near future.

Today, I try to chip away at Datacamp or Python when I can. I've managed to get some basics down, like accessing APIs or running basic regression models. But I treat Data Science like a hobby, something I do for a few hours to a dozen a week (if I'm feeling it). Nonetheless, I don't have it in me to follow the footsteps of what accomplished data scientists have been through.

What can analysts like me practice and build in our ""playbook"" to stay relevant without having to pour 20+ hours a week to hone the craft? Or is DS a subject matter you just can't ""half-ass""?

One I recently discovered was the magic command for reloading local Python modules when changes occur. I'm working half in PyCharm and half in a notebook, so when I'd change something to my modules in PyCharm, the changes wouldn't show up for use in the notebook.

Turns out you can use the magic command above your imports to first load the extension required, then you can define which module you'd like to autoreload:
    
    %load_ext autoreload    # load the extension
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    %aimport DataCleaningModule    # designate which module to reload each cell run
    from DataCleaningModule import text_processors as proc

If you have a .py in your module you want to reload every time (*text_processors* in my case) you just need to use *%aimport* on the module that contains your .py and Jupyter will get the changes every time you run a cell!

What are some of your tips and tricks?

Broadly speaking, there are two really large types of data science jobs out there:

1. What I call ""hardcore machine learning jobs"", i.e., jobs in which you are either working under the hood of machine learning models, or you are deploying them into production environments.
2. What I call ""applied data science jobs"", i.e., jobs in which you are using data science methods to solve business problems.

**If your goal is to work in jobs of the first type, your best bet is to get a graduate degree in computer science**. That is by no means the only way to get there, but that is going to be the best aligned degree to prepare you with the combination of programming, database, algorithmic, math and machine learning that you would need to work on that. (PS: don't @ me to tell me about how you became a Research Scientist at Google with a bachelor's degree in underwater basket weaving)

**If your goal is to work in jobs of the second type, then there are a lot of different types of programs that can get you there.** One general class of such programs are engineering graduate degrees. Why? Because engineering is literally the field that we as humanity created to solve real-world problems using math. 

Specifically, graduate programs in engineering tend to focus on how to apply more advanced mathematical methods to solve more complex problem within their given domains. So, while an undergraduate degree in Civil Engineering may teach you the basics of how to determine the optimal duration of each cycle for the traffic lights at an intersection, a graduate degree in Civil Engineering may focus on developing models to predict how congestion will develop across the network representation of a city's traffic network. While an undergraduate degree in Mechanical Engineering may teach you how to apply pre-determined standards for how to decide on what the tensile strength on a material needs to be on a standard shape like a washer or bolt, a graduate degree in Mechanical Engineering may focus on how to develop a model that best predicts the tensile strength of a component of arbitrary shape.

You get the point: Engineering = solve problems with math, Grad Engineering = solve hard problems with more complex math.

Now, because Engineering *applies* math, in general it borrows from a lot of other areas. There are obviously the core building blocks that they borrow from Math, Physics and Chemistry (e.g., Statics, Dynamics, Electricity, Magnetism, Thermodynamics, Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods, Probability, Statistics, etc.), but in modern Engineering these fields have started borrowing from other ""derived"" fields such as Economics, Computer Science, Business, etc. 

So, for example, Transportation Engineering makes strong use of Network Analysis & Optimization - which came of age in Computer Science - in their use of shortest path/network equilibrium concepts to predict traffic. Industrial Engineering makes use of Econometrics to create models that attempt to optimize responses to customer demand, etc.

The most noteworthy engineering discipline (as far as Data Science goes) is, in my opinion, Operations Research (aka Decision Science). Operations Research was Data Science before Data Science, i.e., it was the first effort by the academic community to use data and analytics to improve decision making. This field was born out of World World II when the British military started using data to make better strategic decisions.

This area has traditionally focused on three big building blocks:

1. Probability and Statistics - specifically with applications to forecasting and stochastic processes
2. Optimization - specifically with applications to finding the best option among a set of possible decisions (and therefore leaning on both mathematical programming, analytics methods and heuristics)
3. Domain expertise: OR has overwhelmingly focused on specific problems that have become ""classical"" OR problems (e.g., vehicle routing, inventory management, scheduling, etc.) which are 1-1 aligned with real world problems (overwhelmingly in the supply chain management world).

Machine learning (and therefore legit data science) have not been traditionally core to these programs, but as Data Science has become more popular, these programs have either incorporated such concepts into their curriculums and/or worked with other departments (like CS) to have their students take approved electives on those subjected.

That makes OR a very versatile degree that is very well suited to start a career is a more business-centric data science role. However, OR is not the only department in which you can achieve that - if you look at the professors and areas of research in each engineering discipline and sub-area of study, you will likely find people doing work in applying data science to their specific domains - and these can also be alternative courses of study *especially if you come from that undergraduate track*.

So, for example, if you did your undergrad in Chemical Engineering, you could look at what programs and professors are doing research in applications of Data Science to chemical engineering problems - and then get a MS in Chemical Engineering where your coursework and research are focused on Data Science. 

It's not the most direct track in that some hiring managers (i.e., non-technical managers) may not understand the relationship. But most technical hiring managers will.

Why is this important? Two reasons:

1. For those who come from an engineering undergraduate background, a graduate degree in their field of study may be a much less daunting transition than moving into a MS in CS, Stats, Math, etc.
2. Engineering programs are going to have much better brand equity than MS in DS programs - therefore, especially for more old-school hiring managers (read: people in their 40s), they may carry more/better weight than MSDS programs.
3. Engineering programs have a lot of research money at their disposal, which means that (especially at good programs), you have a really good shot at not only getting your education paid for, but also getting a stipend *and that is true even for international students*. Also, schools will often want to keep their undergrads as grad students, so you may have even more incentives from your school to stay as a grad student if you were a really good student in undergrad.

&#x200B;

I had no formal experience in data science/AI, although I had much coding experience (mainly python and matlab) from my degrees. So I decided to self teach data science and then apply for jobs. There were many ups and downs in the process as a whole, and a lot of lessons I learned as I went along in the job hunt.

&#x200B;

To form a solid understanding of the machine learning field, I started by going through a machine learning primer on [pythonprogramming.net](https://pythonprogramming.net). I found a nice mix of math theory (low level) and code. The course covered all of the main algorithms used in machine learning by first explaining the behind the scenes idea and then coding a algorithm from scratch and then (in some cases) using it on a dataset. Towardsdatascience also is great (for the right author) for getting a quick easy overview of something.

&#x200B;

After this I applied to my first round of jobs, and found that this is probly not enough to get in the field. I got a few interviews, but response rate was about 7% of my applications (applied for about 50 jobs). I applied for all jobs online, via indeed, glassdoor, etc. While applying I started an excel file listing all applications and dates applied. This gave me a way to measure response rates and see what helped increase this.

&#x200B;

So, after realizing I needed something more, I took on a new undertaking. I reworked through in depth math of the popular algorithms using Elements of Statistical Learning (textbook freely available online). Then, I found some data sets online (either off kaggle or the UCI repository) and went through an entire in depth project on these sets. Data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive. I mean really clean out the problem, I read publications about the dataset, established baselines, interpreted results, etc. I then made a github account and made a data science portfolio and posted a couple of projects on there. Then I reopened the application process and applied to about 50 more jobs. IF YOU TAKE AWAY ANY ADVICE TAKE THIS: make a porfolio and post a project. Choose a project that is socially relevant and any layman could see why its interesting (ie healthcare, not Gaussian data distributions). This astronomically increased my responses. I would estimate that, per 20 applications, I got interviews for 5-6 jobs. After much interviewing I finally got a good offer which I accepted.

&#x200B;

Interviews follow the same basic structure everywhere, and here's what I learned going through them:

1. The HR screen. After bungling a couple of these I finally figured them out; after an HR screen now I would say I have a near 100% conversion rate to a second round interview. They don't know technical stuff, they want to get an idea of who you are and make sure you aren't a weirdo and can articulate yourself. So here's how to ace them: find a project you worked on and explain the technical concepts to them in VERY easy to understand ways. I found explaining algorithms using sports analogies very effective. Relate the project to someone who doesn't care about data science; why is the problem interesting, what are implications of your results. Besides that be prepared to answer the basics like ""why are you interested in this company"", ""how do you face challenges"", etc.
2. 2) the technical interview. The contents of this stage really varies. Most times, I would be asked to explain technical aspects of my DS projects. They would start off with ""explain a project youve worked on and how you solved it"". Why did I use this algorithm and not another, why did I do a dimensional reduction, how did I clean the data, etc. Then, I would get asked to explain the workings of a particular algo I had used. Some would ask that I explain it to someone who didn't know about computers, and some would ask I explain the math and algorithm structure. If you paid attention to my first point you'll be ready for the layman explanation. So be prepared for both. I would really prepare a nice ""lecture"" about an algo, because some would just say ""explain your favorite algorithm"".  Some will go through your resume and ask you to explain buzzwords, so be prepared for that.
3. 3) the coding challenge. These are annoying. They are generally easy, most I got were binary classification problems. A couple I got were just data sets and they said ""do something interesting"". If you've done a DS project it shouldn't be hard. The annoying part is that most would say ""this should take about 4 hours, heres 5 days to turn it in"". So what I imagine happens, is some candidates spend 4 hours and get some interesting insights and send it off, and others spend 5 days straight doing a crazy analysis of it. One company arranged a time I would like the challenge to be sent to me, and I had to submit results within 4 hours. I think this is the best format, as it really puts everyone on the same playing field. I would suggest doing a very simple practice classification problem from a common dataset (the UCI wine thing for example) and just get a ""template"" ready that isn't too difficult to change between basic datasets. Also, some jobs that blasted me a dataset without a phone call or email first I found quite rude and didn't pursue.

&#x200B;

Final tips: I know many people on this sub complain about buzzword resumes; but Ill offer a different take. The people who get a giant pile of resumes to sort through are the HR people; I had a friend who is an HR rep for a DS company look over my resume. These HR people don't know DS; they have a job description for a role that has buzzwords in it (candidate should know regression, tensorflow, blah blah) and they match your resume to that. So I found that by including buzzwords  (listed algorithms I knew, math I knew)  I increased my response rate.

&#x200B;

Also I added a section in my resume explaining the DS projects I had done and tools I used to do them (bold font the tools for fast reading), this also increases response rate (link to your github portfolio too). All in all, the job hunt process is a meat grinder and sucks. I sent out a total of about 100 job applications, got a couple cheapo offers that I declined, and accepted a solid one. I completed about 30 interviews. The whole process took about 3 months. The jobs I didn't get interviews for I think is because I didn't match the description exactly or didn't match the experience requirement, lots of them want big data framework experience which I didn't have (hadoop, apache etc). This would be easy to learn, but the screeners don't know this really so probly tossed my resume. I would've learned it myself but getting 4 coding challenges a week bogs you down a bit :P.

&#x200B;

Remember, the increase in interview requests and inceased knowledge is not just a correlation, it's a causation. As you're applying, learn something new everyday.",0

I had a talk with my manager, shortly after my previous post here. She doesn't really know much (I'm probably being generous, she doesn't know shit) about Data Science and Machine Learning, but she assured me that she'd get me in touch with a BI and Analytics team.

I decided to see how it goes, continued my stay here for the time being, whilst looking for jobs elsewhere nevertheless. I haven't gotten lucky on the job hunt.

A few weeks later, she initiated talks with the BI and Analytics team, and there could be an opening there, but there's no certainty that I'd get to work with them as they're looking for exactly one person, and I might have to compete with about 2-3 senior team members.

Nevertheless, I get a call from my manager today, telling me that I have a week to learn enterprise level ChatBot development with C# and NodeJS, due to two enterprise level ChatBot developers with 5+ years of experience each leaving the company.

My reaction: hahaha wtf.

tl;dr at bottom
My dillema: 
I don‚Äôt know how to move forward with the experience that I have. In fact, I don‚Äôt know which routes I can take yet as I‚Äôm not sure whether the experience I have is enough to move forward. Very confused!
So I‚Äôm pretty stumped at the moment as to where I can go with the experience I have.

Experience I have: 
6 months of SQL(stored procedures and created one custom table)
2 years of VBA (automated a few processes as well as helping another department when they called upon me for help)
3 years of Excel (definitely know my way around formulas and would be confident creating a complicated spreadsheet for anybody, although have never had experience creating graphs.....ever)
Also, I‚Äôve used Cognos Cubes in my current role to extract data but these are simple pivot tables so I don‚Äôt see a point in naming this out on my resume.

The roles that I have held have always been the types where the tasks and responsibilities are repetitive and have never allowed me to call upon my creativity (tbh, I'm not sure if I have any creativity at this point). They have been roles where, if you wrote down a step by step guide, anybody could do the job. This is not to say that the jobs were super easy. The jobs were repetitive but one wrong step, and you've effed up the whole file (you may not even notice you messes up).

The issue is, I feel, that I do not have soft skills that I see in many job specifications that I feel I could go for.
For example, most of the roles require an individual to have experience in pulling insights from data. I have never been in a role where I have helped in this type of way, so this excludes me from many roles.
Additionally, all of the more technical roles require more specialisation in the technical competencies mentioned in the job posting.
For example, SQL Developer roles require specialised SQL experience.

So, what now??
The experience I have puts me in a position where I am unable to do much as I don't any sort of significant experience. I have looked into learning Python, but it is such a diverse language with so many uses that I'm not sure where to start, I mean for one I need to pick a path first.
The goal is, in 5 years, to be able to offer my services to companies as a contractor and become established as a contractor in a field that I choose to go down.
I have looked into roles such as DBA and BI Developer but do not want to pick these two path before I know every possible path I can take from here.

What do you guys think? Are my options wide open because I'm still at an early stage of my career?
For those of you who have been in similar positions, where have you gone on from there?
Are there any recommended websites, blogs, reddit posts you think would help clearing up my head with this at the moment?

Thanks for reading the long post!

TL;DR: 3 years excel, 2 years vba and 6 months sql  experience. With the lack on of insight analysis experience what routes can I take from here??

In summary, my objections primarily fall into four categories:

1. The uncertainty in data science makes point estimates essentially worthless. 
2. Sprints are too short to deliver meaningful results. As a result data scientists often sacrifice documentation, code quality, or model robustness to meet the arbitrary deadline.
3. The product owner has too much direction in the determining the backlog and this often results overlooking important issues.
4. Grooming and other sessions gradually begin to take up more and more time, due to the aforementioned issues (e.g. we need more grooming because haven't delivered stories in the last sprint).",1

I started with data science around 2 and a half years ago in my first year of bachelor's because I really liked data handing at the time. I loved working with messy data and I loved the feeling when I successfully visualised something. Then I learnt about Kaggle and to this day, I always do projects or analysis from there. I've even been able to build a small community of kagglers who support and lift each other.

With all that, I started applying for internships. I'd get rejected initially but I though that that's just part of the journey. I did get a lot of internships and have been able to meet a lot of people. I further moved to domains like machine learning and artificial intelligence and I've been able to get some research papers published as well. I see here, that recruiters love the candidates that can talk to non-tech people and explain their approach and results. I feel like I can do that, I love to write everything that I do as if I were explaining it to a 5 year old. I've also had the opportunity to work with researchers from all around the world.

Yet, I feel like I am not good at interviews and screenings. Or am I just aiming too high? After 2 and a half years dedicated to this field, I often get flustered with screening tasks, I am unable to help people with their doubts, it takes me ages to understand code etc. Most of the internships I have got are through connections and networking on linkedin. I just feel like I have been faking it. I'm not bragging but I have a really nice resume with good internships, good projects, research papers, but I feel like that's just a show because I really don't know stuff. Am I overreacting?

**Example:** [this chart](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/primary-energy-consumption-by-source?time=1965..latest) shows the evolution of global energy consumption by source, with a significant bump in coal consumption since 2000. One thing that's both instructive and not visible in this chart is that ***this bump in coal mostly happened in just one country: China***.

Likewise, by standard metrics, global economic inequality has decreased in the past decades; but if you exclude China the picture is quite different: ***for the rest of the world, inequality has in fact increased*** ^((1)).

**My problem:** Now, when doing exploratory data analysis and plotting such charts, I wish I had **tools that (automatically) point out such inhomogeneities in the data**, especially when the aggregation collapses so many dimensions that it would be impractical to explore all of them manually.

For instance, in the above example of energy production, I could imagine an algorithm that would do some clustering to partition the data into a few country groups (such that within each group the data has in some sense less divergence from the aggregate), and display me one chart per country group.

Haven't found a job on that (so no experience) and recently found a position at the current workplace involved with Risk (might not have ts either). Seeking for advice. 

Hello everyone! 

I'm a DS working at an important Bank in my country. Here I've been dealing with solving problems with unstructured data, like videos, images and text. It's being interesting, but I feel quite unsatisfied. I mean, I studied economics and I'm doing a MSc in Statistics. I love time series in a theoretical way, since I can't find a job that works with them. 

I thought that working at a bank would be cool and have some forecast related projects I could work on... but I couldn't work on any.  

You see in my department there are many areas for data analysis, but not for data modeling, except mine and other. The other area makes churn models, and sometimes recommendation systems. 

I feel I'm taking a wrong path for my future. I have no finance related experience (images, text?) Neither time series Modelling experience (aside from the theoretical one). 

I want to change and I recently found a position at the bank that deals with Risk and I think I might go for it (it's no time series related, but is bank related).  But my boss and the director of the area I work on don't want me to move. They say they really like my work, and that we have many projects we can work on, particularly since my area is gaining a lot of credibility. 

I don't know what to do. I'm not sure if the position in Risk involves modelling and predicting as much as I'd like, or if it will just be analyzing and giving back raw numbers. 

Should I stay and keep looking for TS related jobs, or change to the Risk to gain insights and learn from the bank duties and may find place for forecasting? Should I just take this, grow in this side and hope to find something in the future? 

I'm very confused. And I think that this decision could impact my future, my happiness and many things in my life.",0

963,Am I deluding myself thinking my skill set warrants a career switch to DS?,104,dwwfji,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/dwwfji/am_i_deluding_myself_thinking_my_skill_set/,45,"I am 5 years into my career as a business consultant and have climbed up the ladder to manager (project lead, team lead,involved in hiring and promotion decisions, etc.).

While I generally enjoy doing strategic consulting my real passion is data analysis.

Over the last two years I have prioritized evolving from run-of-the-mill market research analysis towards using more advanced analytics. I use R & Python now instead of SPSS, train ML models (Random Forest, Xgboost, etc.) instead of simply multivariate analysis and have dipped into advanced stuff like neural nets,etc.

I`d really like to switch towards a pure data science role because I like the work and want to get away from consultant work hours.

However in the end I do not have a CS background and while I understand the basics do not have time to really get familiar with stuff like SQL,non-analytics Python and possible languages to prototype apps and front-ends. From a practically stand point my current work really only focuses on analytics (based on mostly available data) as well as the strategic context (which questions to ask, what to do with the answers as well as consulting business on how to develop DS capabilities). None of the models I developed have ever been put into production for example.

I don`t think that would be a problem if I want to switch towards entry level data science but I feel with my business and management background I should aim higher (even if just to avoid a wage downgrade).

Taking this all together I do not know whether I am actually skilled and desirable enough for the senior level data science roles I covet.

What do you think?

Update:

In another post somebody summed up four key dimensions of DS skills which I really liked. So I think my profile would be something like this:

Data Engineering: 1/5

Data Analytics: 5/5

ML/AI: 3/5

966,Data Science Career: Management vs Senior Data Scientist.,101,bq7jqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/bq7jqr/data_science_career_management_vs_senior_data/,24,"I am standing at a crossroads in my career. 

I am the team lead of the data science and analytics team in a med size engineering company. Our tasks revolve around failure analysis, spectroscopy models, mining production data to optimize processes and so on. Generally it is extremely interesting work that involves a lot of math, inferential statistics, sometimes classical ML, occasionally DL (mostly for fun) and a lot of visualization. I am in a great relationship with my boss, VP of Research, who reports directly to the CEO and de facto second in command in our bigger multidisciplinary research team. 

Earlier this year my boss told me that she would like me to become a manager in my own right and take on more organizational tasks. As an incentive the data science team would break out as an independent department serving the needs of the company as a whole, not research first and other departments second. I would have the opportunity to grow the team (we are 4 now) and it goes without saying that the salary would get adjusted accordingly. 

The cost however is that I will no longer be able to spend any significant amount of time doing data science work directly. It would have to be done by proxy of my team. I would set the goals, define priorities, review the work, etc. in other words this is almost a 90 degrees turn on the career path. The focus shifts from technical to business and company needs, customer needs and so on. That is no more thinking how to best setup a PGM to describe and explain the results of experiments that the optics team is running in the lab. 

Alternatively I could just continue to grow as a data scientist. But I am afraid to be too expensive as a front line engineer in 15 - 20 years. I‚Äôve seen it happen before. Guys who spent their entire life doing the engineering work are too expensive by the time they are 50 and are the first ones to be laid off when the times are not so great. In addition our area of research is niche, and while I can easily find transferable skills into other industries, it will be something I will have to proof to potential employers should I decide to change job. 

Has anyone do something similar? How does  running the team as a team lead (kinda first among equals who reviews the work and advices on the best approach) compares to the data science management? Any regrets?",0

&#x200B;

I work with text mining and the most important model that I have is a document classifier. It classifies if a particular document is a contract or not.

&#x200B;

My team created a pipeline that fetches documents, OCR them, classify them and make them available in a web application, so that our users can find them way faster than by using the other methods.

&#x200B;

The classifier was trained with 1K documents and deployed with > 90% F-score to production (I did the training, testing and validation stuff to prevent overfitting). We then needed to tell the stakeholders our classification accuracy, because of that, I sampled 1K from the 33K classified documents and we manually annotated the sample so that we could calculate the number of contracts labeled as not contracts (false negatives) and the number of documents that were not contracts but were classified as contracts (false positives).

&#x200B;

I then looked at the false positives and false negatives for patterns, after finding patterns in the errors, I created regular expressions that reduced the error for some patterns, and re-trained the models for the other patterns that came from new documents that were entirely different from the samples we had in the initial dataset. After updating the model, the F-score went up to > 90% again, and we got better results when looking in the web application, so the problem of performance was solved. BUT, I think my approach to this problem was very intuitive and not very science-y, so I figured out another way of doing this, a more statistical way.

&#x200B;

What I'm thinking about doing in the next time, is to make a [sample size calculation](https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm) using the total of documents in production as the population, confidence level of 95% percent and confidence interval of 3%. Then do a random sample of N documents, annotate them and calculate the F-score.

&#x200B;

Now, my fellow data scientists, I would like to know how you do this kind of performance monitoring for classifiers. Also, do you think that my idea has any flaw ?

&#x200B;

Another thing, my new idea will use a confidence interval of 3%, does that imply that the score that I calculate after annotating documents from my random sampling will have a range of +- 3% ? For example if I calculate a F-score of 94%, does it mean that my F-score, actually is 91-97%, because I did a sample of the population ? Or am I oversimplifying things and this is not how confidence intervals actually work ?

&#x200B;

Thanks in advance for the input, I really appreciate it. Statistics is my weakness, since I entered data science from software engineering field.

This company also seemingly doesn‚Äôt have a data analytics team or person, to the extent that I was brought on and have essentially free will on how I‚Äôm operating in my position. Again, sorry for the lack of information, but for context, the person who I‚Äôm working under was trying to do a very scaled back version of the project I‚Äôve taken in Excel (in a very very basic spreadsheet). Naturally, I threw it into R to analyze the data, and they looked at me like I was some sort of computer God.

My question is, for those of you that have been in my situation, how exactly do you present the ‚Äúhey, I can do this for you full-time, and this is how incredibly valuable having someone like this would be‚Äù?

Will share my story but heavily changed to protect the guilty.  

I work(ed) in a safety field where people die based on decisions. We risk rate things, and use our limited resources to prioritise what we need to fix. For arguments sake, I have put this in the context of safety of vehicles.

Someone in another department came up with a subjective but otherwise understandable way of risk rating. Things  like 

* if there are seatbelts, subtract 1
* add the number of accidents in the last year
* if there is speed monitoring, subtract 1
* if no licence is required, add 2
* subtract 1 for every time they have been inspected  


As you can see, some of these were real numbers, some ordinal, some categorical and so on.

These numbers are added to give a final ""risk"" score for a vehicle. So far, so dodgy.

However, this total ""number"" was then ranked, and then multiplied by the number of passengers to give an overall value, which was then multiplied by the amount of safety dollars we had to spend to work out what we should do.

Needless to say, my mood quickly went from appalled to ""holy shit we need to never let anyone outside the organisation see how we do this...""",0

I also plan to find new ways to implement ML or DL concepts in my present work using existing raw data, potentially including image data. 

 In my work, we work closely with a GIS team who curates our department‚Äôs geospatial data in ArcGIS. I am developing proficiency in Esri tools. 

 At this time, I am weighing the value of doubling down on filling gaps in my math education vs. developing stronger skills in Python/R/SQL. Or both on a longer timeline.

 How valuable is it to use time to address this skill-gap? Taking college-level courses in calculus, multi-variable calculus, linear algebra and discrete math for example will take many years. 

 Realistically, I am at the beginning of this journey. I have a bachelors with a major in Anthropology with some focus in Archaeology, but I do not have a strong background in analytics. Although I can work through data science concepts and use data science tools on the computer, I suspect mathematical education to be a major hurdle. 

 I‚Äôm open to suggestions and know that any strong path forward will take a few years. I‚Äôm prepared to do the work but need to find the best way to optimize my time. 

 I am not opposed to doing master‚Äôs work, but I want to make sure my ducks are in a row and find the right program. Here are some details about my current credentials:
